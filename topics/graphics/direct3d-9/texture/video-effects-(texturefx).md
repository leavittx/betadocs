TextureFX is essentially vvvvs answer to <a href="http://freeframe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeframe/trunk/docs/specification.html" class="extURL" target="_blank">freeframeGL</a>, i.e. a specification for modules that do GPU-based texture-generation, -manipulation and -analysis.  

It's like using filters and layers in Photoshop or AfterEffects, but interactively and in real-time (ie. GPU-based).  

Every video is just a sequence of textures, so there is no difference whether the effects are applied to the static images or to the video streams (represented as textures).  

The whole series of modules/effects is now part of the [Addonpack](https://vvvv.org/downloads). Type 'fx' in the [Node Browser](xref:eeb8526d-0085-4219-a138-32ac397853f1) to get the full list of available nodes.  

The idea was triggered by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/karistouf" class="extURL" target="_blank">karistouf</a></span> in his thread with the almost poetic title <a href="https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/pure-image-treatment-question-wich-evolution-for-vvvv" class="extURL forum" target="_blank">Pure image treatment question: wich evolution for vvvv</a> and implementation is expertly lead by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/unc" class="extURL" target="_blank">unc</a></span>.
