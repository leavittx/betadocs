# NURBS

![](~/img/NURBS.png "")   
*A NURBS with its weighted control points*  




NURBS (short for "non uniform rational b-spline") are essentially B-Splines with a weight for each control point. If all its weights equal 1 the NURBS is a B-Spline.   

* NURBS generalizes both B-splines and BÃ©zier curves   
* they can accurately represent circles and ellipses
