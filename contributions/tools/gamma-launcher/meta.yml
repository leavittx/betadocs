  hello all,
  
  *This is GammaLauncher, a simple application that allows to launch vvvv gamma instances with specific arguments from a simple GUI.*
  
  1.  Usage
  
  When the application first starts, it generates a *settings.xml* file in *%APPDATA\Local\GammaLauncher*. This file contains path to your gamma insatallations (should be C:\Program Files\vvvv), as well as your repositories folder, if you're using that feature. You can customize those paths if needed by editing the config file. To quickly locate this settings file, press <CTRL> + <,>.
  
  Then, simply pick the specific gamma version you wanna start from the dropdown menu, and tick the options you wanna use :
  
  * Allow multiple : allows to start more than one vvvv.exe at once
  * Use repositories : this will overwrite packages from vvvv's package folder with the ones in your repositories folder, if you specify one. This is only useful if you're building libraries for gamma.
  
  1.  Download
  
  **As the build exceeds max file size for upload, I could not upload it directly. So please read along..**
  
  Get the latest version [here](https://github.com/sebescudie/GammaLauncher/releases), or clone the [repo](https://github.com/sebescudie/gammalauncher) and build the app yourself. If want to build yourself, don't forget to copy the ico.ico file to your output dir, otherwise the app won't start.

  - You can now download and install gamma preview builds directly from the launcher! A burger menu on the top left shows the five latest available previews. Simply click one of them to download it (thanks [tonfilm](http://vvvv.org/users/tonfilm) and [robotanton](http://vvvv.org/users/robotanton) for helping with the TeamCity API!)
  - Pressing CTRL+R will check for new builds online
  - If you have the "Allow Multiple" option enabled, you can drag and drop a VL document on the launcher window, which will open it in a new gamma instance.

  **25/10/2020 : 3.4.0**

  - Application now remembers its previous state on startup : anything you pick (vvvversion, startup arguments) will show up again "as is" when you start the application next time

  - CTRL+R allows to rescan installed Gamma versions so you don't have to close and re-open the app if you wanna use a newly installed vvvvgamma
  - When minimized, the app goes to the system tray. From there, you can quickly perform the usual actions : show nugets, show package folders, start a new instance and kill vvvv. Achtung, closing vvvv from the system tray won't show a confirmation prompt, vvvv will instantly shut down
