You want to teach vvvv?

Then it might be helpful to visualize mouseclicks and shortcuts. (clicks'n'cuts...)

This patch renders 
* all current pressed keys
* all current pressed mousebuttons
* and a magnified section of the topmost patch
into a DirectX9 Renderer

Sorry, german keyboard only...
feel free to adapt, modify and upload your version!

cheers
