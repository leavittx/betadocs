  You want to teach vvvv?
  
  Then it might be helpful to visualize mouseclicks and shortcuts. (clicks'n'cuts...)
  
  This patch renders 
  * all current pressed keys
  * all current pressed mousebuttons
  * and a magnified section of the topmost patch
  into a DirectX9 Renderer
  
  Sorry, german keyboard only...
  feel free to adapt, modify and upload your version!
  
  cheers
