  Hi, Just stumbled on Bad Mapper.
  It is assumed that the polygons have four vertices. What if I want a polygon with more or less vertices for masking?
  I changed bin size for polygons in the sub folder patches. But then I started to get weird shaped textures. No wonder :)
  How do I do it?
  Thanks, Bad Mapper is cool.
