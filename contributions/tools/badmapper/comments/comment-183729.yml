  hey guys, 
  i love badmapper, but i also love dx11, so i've made a conversion of the latest v3 bad mapper.
  Now i'm in the point that i have a badmapper that works identical in dx9 or dx11 (in the same module), but probably is more convenient to create a dx11 only badmapper (only a matter of cutting pieces now).
  anyway, if someone is interested, here it is
