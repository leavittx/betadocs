  Inspired by [MadMapper](http://www.madmapper.com/) and [mapping-toolkit (alpha](xref:contribution/mapping-toolkit-%28alpha%29)) badMapper allows to select multiple rectangles from a SourceRenderer and distort those (via homography) in a DestinationRenderer.
  
  Provide a texture with your own content, point your projector to the surfaces you want to be mapped and go fullscreen on it with the *Destination* Renderer. Create/place/size selections in the *Source* and then drag their corresponding cornerpoints to their targetposition by directly operating in the *Destination Preview* Renderer. Selections can be tweaked pixelprecise via keyboard, vertices snap, mappings can be saved/loaded, ... which makes this a perfectly usable tool for simple scenarios. 
  
  Built in an ultra-modular fashion that allows it to be easily adapted to a DX11 version.
