  Another Xmas, another year, another small contrib for you about Android&vvvv!
  A patch to get absolute orientation and linear acceleration from android devices.
  **!!Orientation requires a android device with magnetic compass!!** 
  This patch can use 2 different android apps, HyperIMU thru Wifi or SensoDuino thru Bluetooth.
  The orientation part it's not really finished but works well if you don't need 1:1 precision(see inside the orientation node).
  On some device it needs a bit of index tweaking inside the servers subpatch.
  HyperIMU app is the best for performance while with from SensoDuino it's possible to get a lot more data like from the light sensor, the mic volume, the proximity sensor, gps, temperature, and more..
  
  
  
  Happy Xmass and holidavvvvs ;)
  Sapo
