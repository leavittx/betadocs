  @selavivivi: svvvvitcher is quite old but its concept is the foundation of newer patchswitchers/mixers like [iris-interactive-realtime-image-synthesizer](xref:contribution/iris-interactive-realtime-image-synthesizer) or [md.vis](xref:contribution/md.vis) . even both of them are active projcts they are constantly improving by time. check them out. also IRIS will get a touchDesigner-esque interface soon so you're not limited by channels and effect slots
