  vvvv and addonpack packages for Chocolatey.
  *(Chocolatey is a package manager, apt-get for Windows)*
  
  ##  How to use it :
  
  If you don't have Chocolatey installed, just go to http://chocolatey.org for instructions. It will take about 2 minutes to install.
  
  When Chocolatey is installed, type **cinst vvvv** and **cinst vvvv-addonpack** in command prompt to install vvvv and addons. I recommend run all commands as administrator.
  
  By default, all stuff is installing to **C:\vvvv\version** folder. For me it's ok, but i think some people want to specify default installation dirrectory. I will add this functionality in future packages or maybe someone can help me with this and fork my [repo](https://github.com/smakhtin/VVVV-Chocolatey-Packages).
  
  Update: now we support both x86 and x64 versions. You can type **vvvv.x86** or **vvvv.x64** to install 32 or 64 bit version. Also, thx to Claudius, package now automatically installing C++ dependencies, and if you installing addonpack, it's installs VVVV automatically. We still missing .Net4 and DirectX dependecies.
