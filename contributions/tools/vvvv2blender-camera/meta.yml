  This is a handy tool for any composition-like job with NRT renderings (similar to [c4d2vvvv](xref:contribution/c4d2vvvv)) by getting the camera and the projection view from vvvv and pass it via OSC to blender.
  
  This contribution started as a very ambitious project in an effort to connect these two powerful platforms (vvvv & blender) by using & learning VL concurrently. 
  
  
  
  ##  DO NOT FORGET:
  
  *[Download AddOSC](http://www.jpfep.net/pages/addosc/)
  
  *There is a help patch in root folder and a blend file under assets folder to ensure that everything works fine
  
  * this patch is not spreadable yet - it is pain in the *AddOSC* to create manualy more channels for new cameras' properties anyway - but if you want to have more of these in vvvv then create some <span class="node">vvvv2blender(camera)</span> instances.
  
  
  
  your feedback will be appriciated and rewarded with more patches related to blender and VL so please feel free to comment or suggest things accordingly !
