  Record all exposed values to text files and recall them. Vj much? Maybe you have to show different looks to a client? Come across something wonderful, but its not what your looking for right at that moment? Then you might find this useful...
  Obviously this is just a basic usage
  
  This was wrongly tagged as plugin, there is plugin in there if you want to roll your own GUI, but this is more tool, ie not for use in you contribs folder, but base a patch around it...
