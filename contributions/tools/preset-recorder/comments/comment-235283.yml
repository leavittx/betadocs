  Is anyone else having a problem where this plugin doesn't load as a Contribution? It's listed as a "plugin" on the site tags, so I've put the folder in with all my other plugin contribs but this one isn't being recognised by VVVV for some reason.
  
  Anything I can do to make sure it loads with VVVV?
