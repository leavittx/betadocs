  how cool is this, i was about to start working on something like the "writeIO" plugin. did this exist before or is this made by joreg for you, catweasel ?
  
  edit: ok it's in the patch. thanks joreg.
  
  one question, what is the fastest way to identify the address of an iobox apart from making a plugin for that.
