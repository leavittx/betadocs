  @sanch, Did you see the other contribution I posted (Fantastick Plugin)? It has some basic examples. Also what do you mean by "it will be much better in plugin with a custom type for fantastick string" ? How do you imaging such a thing would work?
  
  Also I will definitely look into using the HTTP (Network Server) node. I didn't realize that node existed.
  
  @screamer, I don't understand the problem you are having, can you be more specific?
