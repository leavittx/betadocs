  I mean you could have different small plugin , one like a device node to get point/acelerometer data ... , an other one like a "renderer" node to draw stuff, and as well quad image text transform ... and some group node  , all this node (plugin) could be connected with a custom pin type (you can create your own pin type in plugin , convert fantastik string into a fantastik node type). So have a nice bunch of plugin that you can patch quickly everything you want.
  I didn't know about the custom pin thing , but this very cool feature for plugin.
  Well if you feel motivated  :)
