  Nice , will be great if you have time to do differrent plugin , like a simple quad / segment / mesh ... to draw in the iphone .
  I did patch that , but it will be much better in plugin with a custom type for fantastick string. 
  I know vvvv can act as an http server , it might be possible to load texture from vvvv directly ? not sure ...
