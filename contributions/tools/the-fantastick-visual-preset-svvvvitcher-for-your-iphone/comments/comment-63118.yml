  sanch, Interesting idea but I would have to experiment more to figure out how that would be useful. If you look at the fanta_presets patch you'll see that all the drawing+logic is being pushed to the iPhone as a JS script. I think that offloading as much logic as possible to the i-device in this manner is the way to go.
  
  In that vein, I am thinking about creating a variable injection/template plugin. So if you have JS code like:
  
  ```
  var mystr;
  for (i=0; i < \$1; i++) {
     mystr += \$2;
  }
  ```
  
  ... then there would be pins to replace $1 and $2
