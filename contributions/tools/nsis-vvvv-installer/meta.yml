  We managed to write a small NSIS-Installer, which makes installing vvvv just a couple clicks away. :D 
  
  Because dependencies are changing often and it was an old project this is only for vvvv_45beta33.7_x86 plus Addonpack and DX11.
  
  It checks&installs DotNet 4.5, DX9, vcredist 2008/2010/2013 and adds a registry entry for AddFlow. After that, you are ready to go (ok, filetype association is missing but we didn't need that)
  
  So, what do you have to do to compile your own installer?
  - Download & Install NSIS
  - Download ZIPDLL-Plugin http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in , Extract ZipDLL.dll to directory Plugins\x86-ansi  in your NSIS installation, Extract ZipDLL.nsh to directory Include in your NSIS installation
  - Download http://nsis.sourceforge.net/DotNetChecker_plug-in and put them in the same directories.
  - Download vvvv_45beta33.7_x86.zip, addons_45beta33.7_x86.zip, vvvv-packs-dx11-1.0.1-x86.zip, vcredist_x86_2008.exe, vcredist_x86_2010.exe, vcredist_x86_2013.exe and put them next to this nsi-script.
  
  In NSIS select the nsi-script provided here. 
  I'm not shure if we are allowd to upload fully packed installers here, so if anybody interested i can provide them. 
  
  One small thing is a little bit annoying: NSIS won't Install to C:\ directly, so vvvv has to be installed in a folder, e.g. C:\vvvv\vvvv_45beta33.7_x86
