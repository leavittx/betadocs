  Hi all,
  
  I tried to build a midi-mapper for the Numark Orbit, a wireless dj/vj controller. 
  
  * The node only works in combination with the vvvv.json mapping file included in the zip file, which you can open and use with the Numark Orbit Editor(download:<http://www.numark.com/ozone>).
  
  * Once you've opened the vvvv.json, you can see how I mapped the Orbit,feel free to change colours and behaviour, but don't change channels or notes, that will screw it in VVVV.
  
  * The Patch: I tried to arrange it as logical as possible, just link the outputs to the desired inputs.
  
  * I preconfigured the 4 Pad Banks in the following way:
    
    Pad Bank 1-3: PadBangs with 2 toggles at the inner lowest row
                  K1-K4 are working as faders from 0-1, as well as the 
                  motion controllers.
    
    Pad Bank 4:   same as 1-3, but intended as color outputs, changeable
                  in the Editor.
    
  * The patch doesn't work when the Editor is opened at the same time. 
  
  It's not perfect, but maybe useful for some of you :)
  
  
  have fun!
