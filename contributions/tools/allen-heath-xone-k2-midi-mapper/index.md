Heres a Midi-Mapper for the Allen & Heath XONE K2 Midi-Controller. It only supports one layer by now, so the latching function won't work too...

But I think it still provides a lot of controls.

Some infos:

* The MIDI Channel of the K2 has to be Zero and Latching must be switched off.

* Just connect the elements you want to control to the desired outputs.

* Switchable Bang/Toggles on all Pads, just use the two Bang/Toggle boxes.

 
* Two Patches: "XONE K2 MidiCompact.v4p", a very "dense" patch  (e.g. to use it in another patch,and "XONE K2 Midi.v4p" in which it is clearer to understand what is going on, so you can improve it.

* The endless Knobs didn't work as they should, so they can only be used as bangs.

I hope you enjoy it!
