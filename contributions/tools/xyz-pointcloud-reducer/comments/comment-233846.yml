  Made a small test with pointcloud data stored in DDS.  Loads and renders really fast and it's easy to control pointcount too!  
  [particles-from-dds](/blog/particles-from-dds)
  
  For reconstructions I use RealityCapture, the sample is from project Forest which we made back in 2014.
  
  1. I've exported photogrametric reconstruction into .XYZ pointcloud
  2. In my tool I've added export to two binary files (.raw) (xyz coordinates stored as Single, rgb as bytes)
  3. Opened the binary files in Photoshop using RAW import
  4. Saved as DDS
  5. Loaded as textures and connected to a custom particle shader.
  
  For huge pointclouds it would be best to have LOD management, something like octree. (Potree for WebGL which you posted does have octree)
