  Did you ever needed to reduce the size of a point-cloud file without reducing the point count? 
  
  I've made this tool which shrinks the text file by removing arbitrary amount of fraction point digits, decreasing the precision as well.  
  
  ####  Example:
  
  <div class="box">
  Before:
  12.137491 6.127559 0.303001 48 47 50
  
  After:
  12.13 6.12 0.30 48 47 50
  
  </div>
  
  
  ####  Usage:
  
  ~np~ XYZPointcloudReduce <-n:0..9> input_file output_file
  ~/np~
  
  ####  Mandatory arguments:
  
  ~np~ input_file Input point-cloud file containing space separated values as strings. Supported formats: ASC, XYZ, etc. input_file Output point-cloud file containing space separated values as strings. ~/np~
  
  
  ####  Optional arguments:
  
  ~np~ -n:0..9 Specify the count of digits after decimal point, lower number results in lower file size. Default value is 3. ~/np~
