  Thoses sketchs for the arduino enables you to send it DMX in art-net. You can send 512 channels from VVVV thruth the DMX (art-net Sender) node.
  
  This works with Duemillanove and UNO, on Arduino 22 software.
  
  Contents:
  
  ***art-net receiver.pde** wich analyse if packets received are really art-net. see the universe, opcodes. Store in a buffer_dmx values. Up to you to do what you want with it.
  
  ***art-net receiver RAW.pde** doesn't analyse anything. Just store the incoming packet as if it was an art-net packet. Dangerous if you use it in non closed and very controlled network.
  
  ***art-net et tlc.pde** wich enable you to use a TLC5940NT to increase heavely number of output dimmable you can have on your UNO. 
  TLC5940 has 14 output and is daisy chainable. Unfortunately, use of Ethernet Shield and TLC on a same arduino board is physically conflicting. 
  For this a hack of the headers in the arduino core header, the ethernet library, and the TLC library. 
  Wiring is changed from the usually wiring you may find around.
  An html doc ( in french and english ) is included in the folder. 
  This hack is  Tofe86 arduino's contribution on the topic of ethernet / TLC conflict.
  
  Just done a little test with my whitecat here: <div class="vimeo embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mt-3 mb-4">
