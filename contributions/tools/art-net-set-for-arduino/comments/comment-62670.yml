  yes sapo you need Ethernet shield !
  <http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield%20>
  
  It works with Arduino 22 ( and surely 21) version. Tested on UNO and Deumillanove.
  
  You upload sketch as usual with USB. Then you can take your arduino on battery or transformator far away. 
  Plug it to RJ45 connected to your computer and send artnet ( you need to edit adress in art-net sender node).
  
  You can test directly the art-net recever with a LED on a PWM pin. 
  At the end of this script you have a place to write your routing of DMX data to analog or digital PIN
  The TLC thing is more complicated ;-)
