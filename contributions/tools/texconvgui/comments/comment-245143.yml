  Oui! 
  Now it works, but i can't view any of BC7_UNORM dds lol
  just hangs vvvv hmmm.... also seems other types of compression also don't work
  
  update: nop BC7 worked like charm, just not with filetex pooled
  update 2: even more weird now everything works like charm for whatever reason.... 
  seems like first time it did something wrong.
  
  Also is it necessary to put resolution in "Resizing" or it takes source?
