  If you leave both at 0 it will take the original size. There are tooltips for every option, just hover over the fields with your mouse. I had "frozen" filetextures too when trying bc7. With the player node everything works fine. 
  Also with bc7 try *Min Compress* and see if it makes any difference qualitywise, it's a lot faster.
