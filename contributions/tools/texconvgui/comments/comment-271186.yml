  The first one I see would be to automatically choose the right number of mipmaps if this number is set (by default) to 0.

  If by "right amount" you mean **all mipmaps** you can do this already. Just set *Mip Map Level* to 0.
  
  
  
  <div class="box">quote:Microsoft:
   --m number: Number of mipmap levels to generate in the output texture. This setting only applies to DDS output, which defaults to 0 which is generate all mipmaps. Use -m 1 to remove mipmaps.
