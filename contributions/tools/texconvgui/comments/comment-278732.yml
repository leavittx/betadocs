  One request: Would it be possible to change the file endings to be lowercase instead of uppercase?
  </div>
  Unfortunately that's the way Texconv writes the files. There is a lower case switch but it affects the whole file name not just the ending and in my opinion that's not really desirable. 
  See also: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/issues/170
  
  So for now it would need a second renaming step, idk when I'll have the time to implement that.
