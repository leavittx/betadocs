  Never tried with exr and/or have encountered that particular error.
  However it seems to be caused by a missing codec/decoder.

  edit:
  OpenEXR support isn't enabled by default.
  
  <div class="box">quote:Microsoft:
  Support for OpenEXR (EXR) can be added to the texconv utility. Uncomment #define USE_OPENEXR in the source, and add the DirectXTex auxiliary module to the project. See Adding OpenEXR for more details including building the OpenEXR library.
