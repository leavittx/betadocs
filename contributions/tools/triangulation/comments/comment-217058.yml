  looking for some help or direction:
  
  I want to adapt this patch so i can throw in an image, and get a random voronoi structure that fills it, and be able to control the line thickness, so it is suitable to use the divided voronoi image with a lasercutter to make stencils. Im pretty new to vvvv and any help would be most welcome
  
  cheers,
  D
