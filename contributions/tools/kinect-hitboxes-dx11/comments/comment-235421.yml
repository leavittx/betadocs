  hi @yochee!
  thanks for the feedback :)
  
  yes, with kinect v1 aka 360 it is possible to use multiple devices, though you need to adjust the patch a it as the output of the kinect node is not spreadable.
  
  probably a faster way to do is to launch hitboxes on two machine, another option is to launch vvvv in two different instances with /allowmultiple command line parameter. each instance should use same table of hitbox coordinated but the transformation of the kinect position and the index should be different.  
  
  when using multiple kinects on a different machine, it's best to have them on two separate usb host controllers. i wonder how do multiple kinects perform if you disable color stream and connect  them to same usb 3.0 host controller.
  
  kinect v1 may overlap, there quality of depth map is decreased because they do jam each other, on the other hand, this does not generate false positives.
