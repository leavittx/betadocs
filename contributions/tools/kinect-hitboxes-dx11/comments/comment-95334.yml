  Thanks Synth, comments and suggestions are always welcome as we'll keep on adding features and publish updates. Could you elaborate further on you idea about camera calibration? 
  
  I believe in case of our point cloud aligning the 3PointsToPlan plugin would do the job. By clicking on a three points in a point cloud, it would get aligned to the axis.
