  hi,
  
  sorry for being late on this. i updated the bitbucket links and marked iris_v0.1 and iris_v0.2 as public repositories. feel free to download and use them for your needs. they should work both with beta 27. i tried 34.2 but got some problems due to updated s-r nodes. 
  as i wrote on top unfortunately iam not able to support this versions anymore. but at least it should not be that hard to get them running even with current vvvversions.
  
  and yes were still working on iris every day using it for big and small productions. but since topics and our needs changed a lot since 2012 iris<>vvvv concept has changed as well. so its not only a vvvv based thingy anymore but more a system consisting of multiple parts. iam sure that we have more details to show @ next node.
  
  best,
  
  i.
