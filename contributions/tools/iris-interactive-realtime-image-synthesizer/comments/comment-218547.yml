  looks supercool. when i launch startMasterInterfacePerformance though, the thing goes nutz. i see the audio part done with max. and there are some unusually colored vvvv patches open. but in addition 3 to 4 vvvv windows open and close in rapid succession. i let it run for a bit but had to cancel after couple of minuets.
  
  am i missing something?
  
  i had to dl iris-r0602.zip, for the bitbucket link tells me to vvvvuck off: "You do not have access to this repository".
  
  Is this .zip simplyt to old?
