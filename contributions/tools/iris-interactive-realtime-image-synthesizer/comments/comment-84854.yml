  Well basically it's the same licence model that also v4 uses. Its free to try and for non-commercial use. If you're making money with it we ask you to get in touch with us for a quote. We have a couple of projects of our own running on iris, but we have no history of licencing it to others... So we'll see how that works out in the future.
