  @Sapo is your vvvv install in Program Files (x86)?
  
  You may need to put some quotes around it- try editing the cmd file to something like:
  
  @ECHO OFF
  start C:\Video\Patches\nsynk-iris-ff70ccab2127\patches\audioanalysis\audio_analysis\audio_analysis.exe
  start C:\"Program Files (x86)"\vvvv_45beta27.1\vvvv.exe /o C:\Video\Patches\nsynk-iris-ff70ccab2127\patches\_Interface_root2.v4p /masterinterface 1
