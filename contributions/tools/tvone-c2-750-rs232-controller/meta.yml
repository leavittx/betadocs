  My buddy just purchased a TVOne c2-750 DVI mixer and was looking for a way to control it. We tried iMixHD from Fader and VJ Leo but it ate up too much processing power. Patched this together in part of a night (edit - Ive spent more time than that now..). There are still many commands to input, but the basic fade from RGB1 and RGB2 are working. (and went from 80%cpu on iMixHD(processing) to 03%cpu with VVVV :) The keyer is working , and background YUV color control.
  
  (also this is my first time packaging a plugin with a patch, let me know of any errors (they all exist between computer and chair;))
