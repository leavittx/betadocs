  Documentation is at https://github.com/microdee/vpm
  
  Now you can browse and install packs from the [VPDB pack repository](https://vvvvpm.github.io/) with ease!
  
  ###  Install / Use
  
  * **Download latest release from** https://github.com/vvvvpm/vpm/releases
  * Register a VVVV with its setup.exe (if it's not done already)
  * Extract anywhere with 7-zip. Extracting with the windows/file explorer vanilla unzipper will put vpm in sandboxed mode and it can't load modules for scripts in sandboxed mode. 7-zip ignores this.
  * Run it at least once so it can register vpm:// or vpms:// uri schemes (vpm links).
  * Click a vpm link (vpm(s)://) or double click a .vpack file

  ##  Troubleshooting
  
  * **VPM Cannot load/use Newtonsoft.Json.dll**
    * Your VPM got sandboxed by Windows, Extract VPM with 7Zip and Windows cannot sandbox it.
  
  1.  Changelog (also manually copied here from github for your convenience):
  
  ##  1.3.0
  
  * Omitted license agreement UI (individual licenses are no longer asked)
  * Improved VVVV folder selection UI
  ##  1.2.8
  
  * Added ThrowException function for scripts
  * Made loading Nuget packages for scripts working
  ##  1.2.7
  
  * Fixed not all assemblies were loaded shipping with vpm
  * Allow drag and drop on folder selection
  ##  1.2.6
  
  * Added a directory selector dialog
  ##  1.2.5
  
  * Updated nuget packages and removed Fody Weavers
    I figured since the actual files are already put into a subfolder, I might as well just put all the DLL's there and not weave them into main exe. This also allows to use all referenced assemblies in the installation script
  ##  1.2.4
  
  * Added a more stylish darker look with MahApps.Metro
    and loading spinners for UX shenanigans
  * Added a "web UI" for vpdb
  * got rid of old vpdb remnants
  * added an example for license pages
  ##  1.2.3
  
  * Vpm can now talk to the license pages through javascript
  ##  1.2.2
  
  * Updated vpm.bat for usage in 'PATH' (by MrRoundRobin)
  * Added license agreement screen
    Powered by a CefSharp control
  ##  1.1.3
  
  * **Add:** from now on releases are published on https://github.com/vvvvpm/vpm/releases and changelog will continue there
  * **Fix:** fixed wrong deleting path when overwriting existing dependency
  ##  1.1.2 (.1)
  
  * **Add:** If the input .vpack's pack is already existing user is prompted to update/overwrite instead of quitting immediately
  * **Fix:** File copying exceptions from the script (like access denied) are handled individually and let the remaining files copy and the rest of the script run.
  ***Fix:** In case of above mentioned exception comes from overwriting read-only or hidden files, vpm will remove those attributes before copying.
  * **Mod:** Ditched directory printing, it was just bloating the console.
  ##  1.1
  
  * **Add:** Now vpm also associate .vpack files during registration
  * **Add:** Improved scripting: now scripts can use assemblies referenced by vpm
  this means pack developers can reference System and some basic namespaces of it with the using statement
  * **Mod:** vpm doesn't require an exiting vvvv anymore. This means vpm can install vvvv and addonpack to its own folder or the folder specified in command line argument.
  * On the point of previous entry vpm now also able to update vvvv to the latest alpha with a vpack file (<a href="vpms://raw.githubusercontent.com/vvvvpm/vpdb/master/vvvv/latestalpha_auto.vpack">Try updating here</a>)
  * **Mod:** it has colors now yaaay!
  * **Mod:** the source tag is not mandatory now
  
  Enjoy!
