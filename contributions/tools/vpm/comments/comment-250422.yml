  unzip latest vpm with 7-zip. windows vanilla unzipper puts executables and dll's into sandboxed mode, so vpm can't load DLL's for the scripts (like the json.net dll's). I can only guarantee 7-zip to not flag files as sandboxed, other programs might do as well. (this is the same as with vvvv you shouldn't unzip it with the vanilla explorer.exe unzipper)
