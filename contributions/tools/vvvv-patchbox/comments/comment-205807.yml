  i think i'll settle for 
  ```
  
  
  ```\|?(\+|-|\*|\/|%|@|=|<|>|i)(\s?<-+>?<0-9>*\.?<0-9>*)+(.*)\|?$
   
        symbol                | value                   | remainder
  ^
  
  edit: I expanded this to allow presetting up to four Values (so you can preset any 2d, 3d or 4d vector). Simply separate by comma or space. 
  Also note that those are now symbols, so you can add any keyword as a placeholder if you want to have more nodes at your fingertips.
  
  i wonder, if we should have a special prefix to be able to call patch macros like that. i.e. column **" : "** could be a nice way to distinguish inline "Node Browser" or an intended comment from the much different "**:**make shit" aka The Mighty Inline Command-prompt to trigger a certain generator patch.
