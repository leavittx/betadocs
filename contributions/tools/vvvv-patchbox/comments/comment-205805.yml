  hey velcrome,
  
  have a look at [ioscaler](xref:contribution/ioscaler), maybe you want to include it.
  
  and here is a half working [snap-nodes-to-grid](xref:contribution/snap-nodes-to-grid).
  not really fun to use so far.
  
  i also made a gui redrawer, but yours seems simpler.
  
  
  cool idea to make this modular.
