  a little big update. here it's a zip containing the new version (.exe and helppatch). Some of the new features are:
  
  - improved performance
  - streaming all the data with a single osc tag
  - positions are now integer (less bandwith)
  - sending joints name, id, confidence, positions and rotations (not all used in the helppatch)
  - a better self explanatory helppatch
  - other stuffs that only hierro knows ;P
  
  ...is coming this night..
