  Trying this now.
  
  Always get the message "Calibration failed for user N".
  
  What I'm doing:
  - Launch the modified NiUserTracker.exe in "C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenNI\Samples\Bin\Release\" folder.
  - Launch vvvv and open "MultiSkeleton (Kinect) help.v4p".
  
  Any help, please?
  
  Thanks so much.
