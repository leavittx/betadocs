  hi sagishi, really appreciated your work :)
  Actually the opennI framework stores positions, rotations and confidence values for all those results.
  When we started sending osc, we just did for a quick playtime in vvvv, also cos it's not that convenient, anyway, actually is a nice crossSoftware solutions for prototyping.
  
  Actually we are already sending rotations and ids over OSC, just we didnt have so much time to fix some buffer issues, to reduce latency, gonna post it soon.
