**Dismissed version, dll updated version here :**  [/sites/default/files/uploads/OpenNIGenericNode.zip](/sites/default/files/uploads/OpenNIGenericNode.zip)


What's included :

1)NITrackerBridge.exe 
2)MultiSkeleton (Kinect) help.v4p

What you need :

- OpenNi framework
- PrimeSense sensor driver kinect mod
- NITE middleware 1.3
- vs2010 redist.

look www.openni.org for downloads and forums

Instructions : 

- start NITrackerBridge.exe and MultiSkeleton (Kinect) help.v4p
- enjoy



Note: This is just a quick hack to play, PrimeSense and OpenNi will release more "tools" and documentation to do that easier; wrapping the program into a vvvv plugin will be helpful too(less latency and direct control within vvvv).
