  I have not tested it but I doubt it @ggml.
  
  The data itself is stored in an XML file so you could potentially copy it into whatever format ex9 expects by hand, I presume the existing ex9 Undistort is also using opencv under the hood (a much older version most likely) but the principles remain the same.
  
  Best of luck to you!
