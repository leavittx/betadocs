  Really amazing stuff, the work you've done on the GUI is so useful!
  
  I downloaded the complete version with vvvv from your site, seems like <span class="node">Connect (Transform Vector)</span> is missing from the worms.v4p patch. Also I can't move the main GUI renderer window around or rescale it but this works with any md.bot renderer.
  
  Thanks for the amazing contribution!
