  Hmm that's interesting. I've just fixed directinput node to use slimdx instead of Ms managed dx so you don't need to install that old version of DX sdk
  Update: I've just realized what's the problem. Will release a fixed version on the weekend
  Update2: Lightmare: fixed the stucked window problem it was quite awkward.
