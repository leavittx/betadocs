  Hi there, 
  
  Thank you very much for your effort with this contribution microdee! 
  
  I'm just trying to run on Windows8 x64 - vvvv_45beta29.2_x86 
  
  
  - I changed the .bat path files in both md.bot and md.mix
  
  - The patch would open only with no window
  
  - I then changed VVVV to start in Windows7 compatibility mode 
  
  - Now the VVVV gray splash square just freezes in the middle of the screen 
  
  
  Any ideas?
