  ##  requirements:
  
  * a stronger pc with intel core i5/7 and 4 gb of ram is recommended if you want to use it with multiple applications
  * windows vista, 7 or 8 for texture sharing. win 7 with aero turned on is recommended
  * on windows 8 set vvvv.exe to windows 7 compatibility mode through properties to make shared textures working
  
  ##  installation:
  
  for vvvv bundled version:
  * place it somewhere
  
  for standalone versions:
  * place both md.mix and md.bot next to vvvv's folder which should be called "vvvv_45beta28.1". if you don't want that edit the .bat files to point to vvvv.exe with absolute path or relative path to the .bat file and the path after the "/o" argument should point to the corresponding patch absolutely or relatively to vvvv.exe
  
  ##  startup:
  
  * for md.mix run "md.mix\_ui.bat" and then double click on the renderer button
  * for md.bot run "md.bot\md.bat" or you can start several instances from md.mix as well
  
  ##  fixed in 1.1.1:
  
  * fixed huge bug showing up when there's a second screen (windows couldn't be moved). i just didn't put a GetSpread after ScreenInfo. tactical-reverse-facepalm for that
  * fixed flickering of images sometimes: that was facepalm worthy too
  * fixed deepness in the sky md.bot patch what was acting weird.
  * fixed unreliable DirectInput (switched from managed DirectX to SlimDX) for moving windows around
  * fixed missing Connect (Transform) node in "worms" md.bot patch
  
  ##  what's new since 1.0:
  
  * making advantage of texture sharing
  * unified interface for md.bot (no need for 2 renderers anymore)
  * new menu system based on regular C# forms
  * drag and drop added to md.bot
  * effects are controlled with HDE so almost all TextureFX filter is listed which is useful for VJing. it's still not absolutely compatible (it supports value datatype only)
  * IRIS like sequencer is added to md.mix
  * if the effects planes have so many sliders that they go "offscreen" you can scroll them with mouse wheel instead of the vertical mouse movement stuff
  * the whole system is much faster now
  * fft, scope and clock (tempo) is sent on shared memory from md.mix
  * faders in md.mix reacts to raw kontrolleur touches on port 44445
  
  ##  upcoming in near future:
  
  * VLC sequencer for md.bot so videos could be jammed in finally
  * beat detection (currently i have licensing problems with that or need for regular Bass audio input not asio)
  
  ##  upcoming in far future:
  
  * md.map: a whole new mapping utility basically a mad-mapper clone but with augmented 3D support and elliotwoods's calibrate-projector method and a mesh/svg editor and etc. etc. currently i'm at the planning phase with that. only the xml structure for the project files are ready
  
  ##  major known bugs (so i'm working on those):
  
  * sometimes md.mix can behave strangely while adding or removing to the sourcelist
  * some mysterious shit with menues and tooltips. i cannot even describe that but it's very rare (some was fixed since the tutorials)
  * after opening a menu then rightclicking on another button with menu won't open that menu but stays with the previous menu. workaround: close the menu with leftclick somewhere else before opening another menu
  * midi or osc learning from interface without opening TodoMap throws an exception and creates dosens of mappings of the same controller. it's a bug of TodoMap. i've already written a forum post about it let's hope for that new version what was floating among the screenshots
  * exception during startup. i don't know what's that. ignore it and click continue
  
  cheers! :)
