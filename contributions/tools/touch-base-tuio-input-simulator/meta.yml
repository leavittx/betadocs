  1.  Touch Base
  
  ##  *For all your multitouch needs*
  
  Detailed tutorials to come. 
  
  This tool is designed for developing and deploying multitouch applications which use the TUIO protocol. 
  
  To start creating your own multitouch application head to the folder:
  
  Touch Base\Applications
  
  And then rename the *Multitouch Application Template* folder to the name of the application you will be developing.

  ##  Touch Simulator
  
  When the mouse is over the main renderer the XY pos is used to show where a touch point is. The touch point only becomes active when the left mouse button is hit. 
  
  The bottom section of the touch simulator is for manual input of touch positions.  
  
  
  ##  Using a touch enabled device
  
  The "Tuio Transform" patch has the UDP node where the data from your touch device is received. Currently the UDP node is set to port 3333, which is a the standard port, if you are not receiving touch information, check the port number of your device and adjust the UDP node accordingly.
  
  To enable touch from your device to be sent to your application, turn off "Simulator".
  
  You'll also want to turn off "Touch Points" when not testing.
