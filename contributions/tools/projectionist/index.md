Hi VVVVolks, 

this is my very first contribution ;)
i startet this project during a boring exhibition standy job to expand my patching skills and create a useful tool for me... 
i am an absolute patching beginner, so maybe there are some nodes and wires that a pro would patch in another way :)


Basic Features:
- calculate a projection (overlap, optic ratio, pixelsize)
- configure a testpattern for the calculated projection with:

* grid
* outlines
* circles
* softedge markers
* crosses
* text


I am curious about feedback and maybe there are some videotechnicans out there who could use this generator...
