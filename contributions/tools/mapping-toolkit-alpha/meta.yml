  This is an alpha release for NODE13 festival, I will add better documentation asap.
  
  The mapping toolkit is a pack of patches / modules dedicated to projection mapping. The first two are:
  
  * MAPPING TOOLKIT - SVG
  A tool to animate SVG files, and produce visual content simply, and in realtime. Classic points and lines animations are available, and it's easy to add more animations.
  My todo list, if you'd like to help ;) http://piratepad.net/9RVN59jG1o
  
  * MAPPING TOOLKIT - WARPING
  A texture sampling, output warping patch: crop, sample any texture (image, remote content, video, generative animation), and then distort, warp that texture on the video output. Useful for multiple output, and simple warping to re align a projection mapping.
  
  These patches are still incomplete, but expect regular updates here, and feel free to ask for new features and questions.
