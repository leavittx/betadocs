  yes, Antialiasing settings are missing in the dx11 cubemap renderer.
  
  in real life, this does not matter much, because after projecting into a spherical dome everything will look different anyway. if aliasing still prevails, try to simply oversampling (setting the resolution of the intermediate cube texture a little higher than necessary)
