  Hi 
  
  I just notice the license and notice the little nc and sa. How would one go about licensing this for commercial use?
  
  I don't actually need this for a commercial project, but I was just wondering about it, I remember a thread some years ago about the license of contributions and thought it might be problematic in some instances.
  
  Perhaps an option to set a license when you make a contribution would make some kind of sense.
  
  Just wondering
