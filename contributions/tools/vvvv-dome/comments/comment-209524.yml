  Thanks, at the moment it looks a bit complicated to pull it out right and definitely is out of my writing skills.  
  My other question is how to deal with alias like problem inside of the dome, I keep getting this saw like effect on the lines and borders. Tried to change resolution settings but no luck atm.
