  Thanks for the questions, it helps me to relate. Licensing is a touchy subject, and we should consider a different thread for discussing broader implications. 
  
  But to your questions:
  I have the notion that CreativeCommons ShareAlike does not force you to publish your instrument, it only wants you to use the same CC again if you choose to give your instrument to anybody else or make a copy to someone else's system. SA pinches here: You can only give it away to all, not to just one. 
  
  What I gather from your feedback is the need for a different license for content. Maybe I can exempt the Content-Folder and open that up for anything-goes, as defined in its folder, or default to ![CC4 BY-NC-SA](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)
  
  Would that be acceptable?
  
  And as I said before, for all the the grey areas with money or secrecy involved, just head over to **license (at) intolight.de** to negotiate fair terms beyond this license
