  This pack provides the basic building blocks to create immersive content for any dome type architecture, similar to [dome-master-full-dome](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/dome-master-full-dome). 
  
  It comes with the following modules
  
  **Dome**: allows quick adoption of the setup to your specific dome type
  **DomeMaster**: creates a valid DomeMaster output for your setup
  **DomeImmersion**: allows to move the *Point of Immersion* in realtime
  
  All content can be placed in a Sandbox, independent of the rest of the engine and the specific dome setup. My hope is that this will foster independence of content from the specific dome you are working at.
  
  
  ###  Missing features
  
  - a mapping feature to drive softedged beamers directly, building upon **DomeMapping**
  - a texture based import/export of warpmaps and softedge
  - some basic post fx for cubemaps (blur, sharpen, glow, etc).
