This pack provides the basic building blocks to create immersive content for any dome type architecture, similar to [dome-master-full-dome](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/dome-master-full-dome). 

It comes with the following modules

**Dome**: allows quick adoption of the setup to your specific dome type
**DomeMaster**: creates a valid DomeMaster output for your setup
**DomeImmersion**: allows to move the *Point of Immersion* in realtime

All content can be placed in a Sandbox, independent of the rest of the engine and the specific dome setup. My hope is that this will foster independence of content from the specific dome you are working at.


###  Missing features
- a mapping feature to drive softedged beamers directly, building upon **DomeMapping**
- a texture based import/export of warpmaps and softedge
- some basic post fx for cubemaps (blur, sharpen, glow, etc).
