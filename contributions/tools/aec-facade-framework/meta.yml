  A patch framework for running different visualisation-patches on the Ars Electronica Center's media facade. Available patches can be selected and a 2D (unfolded) and 3D preview are shown while the individual lights colors are sent to the AECs facade controller software via UDP.
  The framework also includes a simple template patch to start from when creating a new visualisation for the facade.
