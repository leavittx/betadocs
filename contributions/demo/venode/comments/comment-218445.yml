  sometimes digging deep in the past can be rewarding, but forging something new is usually much more pleasant
  
  vvvv-Message has undergone drastic change in the meantime, and interfacing to other apps was a priority. The whole session handling in the old upload is still cumbersome and long revamped. Json talk has been changed in a way that can be described as breaking: it is no longer quick and dirty, but readable. 
  When prototyping against venode, a lot of <span class="pin">Message</span> nodes were WIP and afterwards didn't make the cut and morphed into something more powerful.
  Venode would have greatly benefited from a sync, but as it goes, it didn't happen yet. 
  
  That said, with vvvv-Message it is easier than ever to interface to any javascript object. Iirc @tmp used vanilla jquery. Accessing gui elements with a current vvvv-Message pack should be a blaze for someone with a little time on their hands and some familiarity with js.
