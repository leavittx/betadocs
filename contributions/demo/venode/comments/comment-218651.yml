  I have just recently started using venode5 without Messages - since it is all JSON, I just use [JSON Parser](https://vvvv.org/contribution/json-parser) (here in contribs) and do everything directly in JSON.  So yes it is possible to use it without Messages.
  
  That being said, I rather prefer the look of the version of jquery.mobile that venode3 uses (1.2, easily upgraded to 1.2.1)
  
  Here's the patch that decodes the JSON; unfortunately the rest of the nodes I did are somewhat tied into my other patches and config system, so I would have to clean them up to post them here in a sensible form.  But I can make a pass if there's interest.
  
  EDIT: Ooops, can't attach a patch here, so here's a pic to give you an idea:
