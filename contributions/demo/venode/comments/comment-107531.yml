  ok i found it..
  
  in the function **socket.on('disconnect', function (){.. });**
  you remove all listeners: **serverUdp.removeAllListeners("message");**
  
  after uncommenting this everything works fine. probably the listener for the disconnected client should be removed.. but i cannot find a solution to do that.
