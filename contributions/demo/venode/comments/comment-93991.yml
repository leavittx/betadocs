  There could be different problem , but that's difficult to say , you could check if you have a javascript debugger to enable it and see if there is any error. I tested it only on the last ios on iphone/ipad it was working , so can't really tell for other device. It migh come from javascript who sometime miss some feature on some browser. I think enabling javascript debugger is a good start to see what's going on.
