This helps to smoothly insert one image into another. Not sure why it is called image cloning but here is the original paper this is based on:
http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danix/mvclone/

The translation to hlsl started from this work by Arturo Castro:
https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution/tree/master/GPUCloning/bin/data

Comes with a version for both DX9 and DX11.
