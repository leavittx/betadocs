  Simple demo reading BVH mocap data and rendering it in 3D space.
  This is a very didactic and probably-not-too-efficient patch. It reads the data from TCP in string form (not binary) from Axis Neuron, the software for Perception Neuron mocap system.
  
  *Note: I am not a heavy vvvv user and this patch was made several months ago to check how communication between these programs went. However, rough as it is, I figured it might be useful for others beginners or people just willing to test it out.*
