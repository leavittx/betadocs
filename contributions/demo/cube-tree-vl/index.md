Little demo of how to create tree structures with transformations in VL.
Also to click around und learn some VL concepts...

Needs [vvvv alpha](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews) with integrated VL to run.

Note:
This is now included in the VL integration pack and comes with the vvvv download. Have a look into the /girlpower folder.
