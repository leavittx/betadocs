  Hi!
  While learning this amazing software, I built this little game with a levelgenerator. 
  My first "big" project. Just for learning and understanding a bit more of the multipurpose toolkit. 
  Still in progress, but now out of time ;)
  Have fun!
  
  Start: 
  "Leftclick into the renderer"
  
  Moving:
  "<left> and <right>"
  
  PS: I built it with 2 monitors, maybe you have to -fullscreen- your renderer again. If something is missing, I`ll post it here...
