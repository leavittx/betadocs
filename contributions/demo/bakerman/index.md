Hi!
While learning this amazing software, I built this little game with a levelgenerator. 
My first "big" project. Just for learning and understanding a bit more of the multipurpose toolkit. 
Still in progress, but now out of time ;)
Have fun!

Start: 
"Leftclick into the renderer"

Moving:
"<left> and <right>"

PS: I built it with 2 monitors, maybe you have to -fullscreen- your renderer again. If something is missing, I`ll post it here...
