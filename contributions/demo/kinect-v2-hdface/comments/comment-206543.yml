  added a basic helppatch for HDFaceBuffer. still the tracked face is somewhat off which seems to be related to some missing coordinatemapping. it seems though that <span class="pin">BMinXYZ</span> and <span class="pin">BMaxXYZ</span> can probably be used to achieve that. any clues on how to use those @microdee @vux?
