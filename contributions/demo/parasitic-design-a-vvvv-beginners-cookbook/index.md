**Parasitic Design** is a series of demo-patches with detailed explanations that closely resemble the output of their originals which are the processing-examples that come with the book
 <http://www.generative-gestaltung.de> 
which btw. is available in [english](http://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-Processing/dp/1616890770/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1345550558&sr=1-1&keywords=generative+design) and [fran√ßais](http://www.amazon.fr/Design-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ratif-Concevoir-programmer-visualiser/dp/2350172155/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1345550741&sr=8-2) now!

They work nicer with the book at hand but also without the book you should be able to learn by just inspecting the patches. If you're completely new to vvvv first get it from the [Downloads](https://vvvv.org/downloads) page (make sure to not forget the addonpack!) and make yourself comfortable with vvvv by starting to read in the [Using vvvv](xref:fbc5a2de-2925-4242-90d1-1fa3b080140b) section. Then download the latest package below and browse the examples one by one. 

Looking through the examples you'll notice that some of them are not really suitable to demonstrate the strengths of vvvv. Nevermind. Those examples are there for all of us to find out more about vvvvs weaknesses. We left out only a few that we found too embarrasing to implement..

Muchos gracias go out to the patchers who spent countless hours on creating, documenting and cleaning the patches for you: [roman_g](http://vvvv.org/users/roman_g), [ridike](http://vvvv.org/users/ridike) and [robotanton](http://vvvv.org/users/robotanton). Plus special thanks for beta-testing and -critizism to [anna](http://www.kingkasimir.de/). And an extra quad to the generative-design-team for their kicking us and the mention in the English version of the book. Horray. 

You may also be interested in browsing the samples as videos and download them individually, which you can do via: http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/1/code

**Requires beta36 and the Addonpack**
