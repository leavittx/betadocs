  ## What is template? 
  
  The template is a solid structure of patches and common modules, used for any project. It helps to keep patches readable, editable, clean and flexible. Also **it saves a lot of time during the developing** and when apply any future changes. 
  Any professional studio has it's own template - all the templates are similar in general concept and differ in details. We use this template for last 5 years.
  
  If you are going to be a vvvv patcher in professional studio - it's a good idea for you to learn to keep your patches structured and readable. This will give you a proper example. 
  **If you are going to be a vvvv patcher in Ivan Raster software lab - you must learn the template.**
