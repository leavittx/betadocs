  Well, when I first came across FRAMED, this was and still is! on the Kickstarter page:
  <div class="box">
  "What types of content is supported?
  
  Basically any formats that will run in a web browser is supported, including: still imagery, GIFs, animation, video, flash, processing, HTML5, and more."
  </div>
  
  Now, I'm probably being a bit dense here as it's essentially a Windows computer (right?) so why shouldn't it do .v4p - It does, yes? ;)
  Because, Oh Mann!, I want one!
