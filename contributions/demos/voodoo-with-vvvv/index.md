The Voodoo Camera Tracker <http://www.digilab.uni-hannover.de/docs/manual.html%20>estimates camera parameters and reconstructs a 3D scene from image sequences. The estimation algorithm offers a full automatic and robust solution to estimate camera parameters for video sequences. The results are useful for many applications like film production, 3D reconstruction, or video coding. The estimated parameters can be exported to common 3D software or as a simple text file.
This Patch shows how to use the exported data within vvvv.

The project was initiated by Benedikt Groß. You´ll find the original project files at github: <https://github.com/b-g/vvvv_voodoo_3d_matching/>
