  I would like to share with you my ongoing v4 learning project.
  It turned out to grow into something like a little box2d sandbox.
  It is not that sophisticated and many box2d features are
  still missing, so I prefere to call it playground.
  
  ####  Features:
  
  -Drawing basic shapes in three flavours (Box, Circle, Triangle).
  -Dynamic/static shapes. Density, friction, restitution settings.
  -Mouse interaction with objects.
  -Chaining objects by distance or revolute joint.
  -Deleting objects.
  -Saving/Loading scenes.
  
  
  There are still many places to improve and change,
  but in the end I am pretty happy how it works for now
  and hope you like it too and have some fun with it.

  -Subpatched all the mess. Should make more sense and be better readable now.
  -Triangles are now made with woeiÂ´s mesh join, so each is a subset. 
  -Many small changes and optimizations in several places.
  -Added evaluation triggers for some parts that do not need to run all the time.
  -Added revolute joints to create hinge like connections.
  -Runs well in 45beta27.2 and AddOnPack
