This patch and shader demonstrate how you can use a depth buffer as a shadow map to cast shadows from a light source.

Note that this is meant more as a learning tool than for your final projects, as there's many aesthetic improvements that should be made before deploying as a virtual scene lighting tool.

I've uploaded it here mostly to demonstrate the principle of how to perform this type of shadow mapping.
