  INTZ is for recent (DX10+) hardware. With recent drivers, all three major IHVs expose this. According to ATI <1>, it also allows using stencil buffer while rendering. Also allows reading from depth texture while itâ€™s still being used for depth testing (but not depth writing). Looks like this applies to NV & Intel parts as well.

  It should work on NVidia, ATI and Intel
