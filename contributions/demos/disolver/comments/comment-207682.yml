  Here is a small patch where you can see how to achieve the same behaviour (and alot more) with DX11.Pointcloud:
  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51232449/vvvv/DissolverWithDX11Pointcloud.zip
  
  All you need is the latest version of [[dx11.pointcloud](xref:contribution/dx11.pointcloud)](dx11.pointcloud) in your packs folder.
  
  As small addon you can find a wallpaper I made some months ago :)
  Have fun.
