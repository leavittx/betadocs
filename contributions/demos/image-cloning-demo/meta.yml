  This helps to smoothly insert one image into another. Not sure why it is called image cloning but here is the original paper this is based on:
  http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danix/mvclone/
  
  The translation to hlsl started from this work by Arturo Castro:
  https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution/tree/master/GPUCloning/bin/data
  
  Comes with a version for both DX9 and DX11.
