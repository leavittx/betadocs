Enables you to interface with CNC machines in Real-Time when using the GRBL or TinyG (most makerbots for example use these)

Also it is very smooth and stable with integrated Homing, reset, end positions....
So not only for CNC but a lot of other motor projects

GRBL:

TinyG:
-> https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG/wiki

works with most current versions
