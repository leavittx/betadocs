  Small contribution for Christmas, as usual in collaboration with FlatEric
  
  So this year it's a little bit different, since working a lot on new DX11 build (announcement and roadmap post coming soon).
  
  So instead here are few DirectX11 examples that I found back from the depths of my laptop, hope they prove useful ;)
  
  In no order:
  * Skinning example
  * some GSFX techniques
  * Various tesselation samples.
  * UV map
  * Frustrum culling in compute shaders.
  
  Also, since Eric was slightly bored of looking at his task manager CPU usage, and is pretty busy at deprecating current transform datatype for a new Matrix type, which will be new default for next DirectX11 release, he decided to add a few standard nodes (28 to be precise), which allow you to explore the fact that you have more than one CPU in any modern computer, just as little teaser for what's next ;)
  
  Please make sure you download c++ 2013 runtime to make them work (32 bits only for now)
