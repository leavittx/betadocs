  don't know why it's shifted, but it happens only with rgb.
  Trying with ir or depth instead and it is perfectly aligned.
  A walkaround that works perfectly for me is to add a translate after the perspective node, and translate the camera view of x: 0.053 and y: 0.004
  in that way the face is perfectly aligned with the rgb image. I've tried to understand why that numbers, and tried to compute all the numbers i can together to achieve that numbers, but no luck, anyway it works perfectly ;) thanks again
