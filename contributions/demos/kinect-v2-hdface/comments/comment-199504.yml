  unfortunately i cannot try it now, but it worked for me.
  Have you copied the NuiDatabase folder from the sdk path to the kinect 2 pack, as written in the credits of the contribution?
  
  
  ....for work this patch needs dx11 a kinect2 packs installed, and to make it work, take the nuidatabase folder (that should be something like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\v2.0_1409\bin\NuiDatabase" and you have to copy the entire folder to your kinect2 pack folder
  
  let me know, anyway i'm planning to try it out with the new version of vvvv and kinect2 pack as soon as i can
