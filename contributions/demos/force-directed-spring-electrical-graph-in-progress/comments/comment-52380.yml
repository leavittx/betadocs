  hey john,
  
  thumbs up for going the extra mile! i found the demopatch is slightly irritating with unconnected branches drifting away.. (maybe it would be nicer to make sure there are no separated branches) other than that it looks really nice! (maybe filenaming could be improved too ;)) keep the good stuff coming..
