  hey john, 
  sorry for the late reply. i somehow did not notice. i was probably just a bit nitpicky as i usually avoid filenames like "copy of .." and similar. also a prefix which clarifies that these submodules all belong to one bigger module would not hurt, but as already stated maybe i was just a bit nitpicky on that day. ;)
