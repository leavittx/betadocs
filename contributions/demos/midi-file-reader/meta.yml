  As a response to this thread: [read-midi-file](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/read-midi-file)
  
  This is around 10 betas old work in progress/never finished project. Comes with no warranty and bad style. Appears to still work in beta31, you need to provide your own .mid file and preferable a midi-keyboard for extra fun.
  
  Hacked together to fit my needs and might not provide everything you want.
  
  Will most likely redo something better in relation to work on vvvv audio.
  
  Mouse/Keyboard control:
  
  Space - play/scroll highlighted part
  PageUp/PageDown - Move through file
  Home/End - Go to begining/End of file
  
  Left Mouse button - Highlighed selection Start
  Right Mouse button - Highlighed selection End
