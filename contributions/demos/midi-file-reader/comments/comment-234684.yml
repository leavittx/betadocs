  beta>35 ships with MidiFile (Midi) and MidiTrack (Midi). The former takes a .mid file and the latter (when connected to the former) returns spreads of Channel, Note, Velocity, Start Time, End Time and some meta-info texts for each channel. 
  
  available in [alphas](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews) now.
  
  side note: this is a native VL implementation (ie. not using an external library) and can thus easily be extended if need be.
