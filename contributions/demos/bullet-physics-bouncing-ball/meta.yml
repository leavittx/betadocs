  I know this is not a real contribution.. but..
  Because everything I know is wrong I'll post here.
  Maybe it could be usefull for someone.

  Since the first release of Bullet Plugin by Mr. Vux, I always wanted to mess around with this strong physics engine. Because is not so easy to use I'm starting really simple with this patch.
  
  If you're more skilled in Bullet application feel free to change the patch or make more advanced patch and share again here.
  
  There are no help files for the nodes of this beatiful plugin because most nodes are inter-dependent so this could be a good way to learn.
  
  To see the shadows you'll need
  [soft-shadows-for-point-light](xref:contribution/soft-shadows-for-point-light)
  If you can live without just disable them from the bottom of the patch
