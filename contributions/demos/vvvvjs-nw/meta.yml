  I really like vvvv and Node.js, and vvvvjs is just in the middle of both.
  
  Tonight I'm going to share an experiment. I think that most of the users like vvvvjs but it is difficult to try it out, since not everybody has web development skills.
  
  Well, if I look far away, I can see a vvvvjs.exe that you put inside vvvv folder and is able to browse all girlpower patches ... maybe you can think I'm crazy .... YES I AM ! of course
  
  But take a look at this experiment. It was realized in less than two hours, using node-webkit (check it out, is very interesting) and vvvvjs.
  
  I just took vvvvjs examples folder and used node-webkit to create a vvvvjs.exe that everybody should be able to run and try some vvvvjs patches.
  
  Strictly speaking, 
  
  node-webkit = Chrome + Node.js 
  
  and 
  
  vvvvjs-nw = node-webkit + vvvvjs
  
  Technically, it could run on Mac and Linux too. It could evolve in a simple way to run a vvvvjs server.
  
  Let me know if you imagine any direction it is worth to go.
  
  Ciaooooooo
