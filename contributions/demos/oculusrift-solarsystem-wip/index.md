A quick Solar System for the OculusRift, WIP, with a bit of Lens Flare too (@Hadasi was that something you were after?)
Its been sitting on my drive since the end of August, so I thought I'd upload it in case its of use to someone...

I already had a solar system I'd made for the Modified Toy Orchestra, the starting scene is below, can't find a picture of the solar fly through!
