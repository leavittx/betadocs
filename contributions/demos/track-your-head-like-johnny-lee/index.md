a copycat patch of Johnny Lee's Headtracking VR Demo.

Move your mouse to simulate your headtracking. This patch could be easily extended with some kinect headtracking or the new facetracker.

i tried to help a student today and patched this to get an understanding of it. PerspectiveLookAtRect does all the work.

I hope this might be of help for someone too.
