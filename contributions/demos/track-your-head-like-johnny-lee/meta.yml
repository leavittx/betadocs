  Move your mouse to simulate your headtracking. This patch could be easily extended with some kinect headtracking or the new facetracker.
  
  i tried to help a student today and patched this to get an understanding of it. PerspectiveLookAtRect does all the work.
  
  I hope this might be of help for someone too.
