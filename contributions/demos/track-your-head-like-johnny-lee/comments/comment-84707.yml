  Here's a quick version of u7angel's patch with Kinect head tracking.  Just define your monitor/screen size, and set the offset from the center of the screen to where the Kinect is, and this should work.  In the patch it is set for a screen 1 meter wide, with the Kinect sitting right underneath it.
  
  YAAARGH!  I can only attach a picture.  Guess I'll have to make a new submission....
