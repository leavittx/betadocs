  hi, I am trying to replicate this effect in gamma+Stride but I noticed that when I add Z movement (getting closer or further away from screen) things don't look quite right.
  
  In this patch if I move the Translate Camera's z value to move "into" the room, the objects in the back move away from me when they should move closer, when I move away from the room, the objects in the back come closer to me.
  
  Any idea why this is happening and how I might be able to correct it?
  
  Thanks.
