  the clone is needed only when you 
  * use the new depth texture format INTZ which basically gives you access to the depthbuffer
  * AND you want to use a FrameDelay (EX9.Texture) or a Queue (EX9.Texture) or any module that uses one of those nodes (e.g. FrameDifference (EX9.Texture)) afterwards.
  
  depthbuffer textures can't be cloned internally. therefore we need another renderpass which renders the depth content onto a new texture with any userspecified "normal" texture format.
