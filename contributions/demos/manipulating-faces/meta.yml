  Besides its full body/skeleton tracking capabilities the Kinect also features a dedicated face tracking functionality. With it you can easily identify individual parts (eyes, nose, mouth) of a face and then manipulate, replace, extend those using texture- or geometry-based techniques.
  
  The download comes with 13 different demos on what you can do with the tracking data. 
  
  Note: 
  * Requires b32.1 + addonpack + dx11 pack
  * Those demos will not work with Kinect2 out of the box but should be fairly simple to adapt once the Kinect2 nodes also features face-tracking capabilities.
