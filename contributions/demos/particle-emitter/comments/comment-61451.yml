  hey sapo. maybe i´ll find some time within the next days so i can convert the patch to the 3rd dimension. don´t know if its going to work with the gridsegment node i´m currently using... and spheres... well spheres are possible but a bit heavy and i think the framerate would drop hard. we´ll see.
  killing "old" bodies isn´t that simple, since there is only a small amount of bodies which are used over and over again... see explanation beneath the patch...
