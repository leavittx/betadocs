  hey velcrome,
  
  yes, nice! this should really cover most cases!
  this dynamic datatype system is flexible and there are only few things that you have to get right as a user:
  * if you have different dynamic datatype ("messages"), remember which can be connected to which (but good naming of ioboxes should do the trick already)
  * when changing the datatype "configuration" (seldom enough), remember to change it on every split and join
  
  so at least there are theoretically some advantages still for doing own datatypes. but having it the easy way is a really nice thing!
  
  i hope ppl still got something outof the workshop...
  
  oh and jacketwise: you're velcrome!
