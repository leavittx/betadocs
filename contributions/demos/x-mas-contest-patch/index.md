Hi All

I was fortunate enough to win in this X-mas contest so I'd like to share the patch I made for it.
Use it to make your own slightly different images from my image or just get dizzy from looking at the stripes moving.
It it pretty vanilla vvvv, just the font I used, Omnes Light, is not standard.
Merry Christmas.

PS. Feel free modify and upload your changed version here if you are up for some Christmas fun.
