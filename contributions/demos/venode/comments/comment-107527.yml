  hey!
  
  i have some trouble sending data from vvvv to the client via broadcast or directly.
  
  for that i open up several tabs and connect to the app. the vvvv data is received without problems and sliders are updated in all tabs.
  
  but when i close one session the remaining tabs dont update the sliders anymore. this happens when i use broadcast or the session ids.
  after opening a new tab everything works fine again.
  
  do you know that bug? 
  i tried it with nodejs v0.10.18 and v0.8.25 in combination with vvvv_45beta30.2_x86
