  There is a techdemo about that idee , i did a basic joystick for phone , performance are still a bit to slow depending on what you want to do , i found it a bit slow even on local network from phone (iphone for my case)
  If you want to do something reactive like stearing a car/ship i think it's still to slow . Problem seams to come from the phone not able to send/receive a lot of data as a laptop , the phone browser might even crash if you send to much data. But well there is still many other idee/interaction to do where you don't need huge amount of data.
