  Ok, No familiarity at all, I'm sorry...
  I would just take advantage of the new features:
  
  * new: communication completely via JSON
  * new: consistent session & data storing in vvvv
  * new: added message interval to avoid too many pushes (important for mobile devices)
  * new: responsive weblayout (with skeleton)
  * new: added more UI elements (colorpicker, 2dpad, bang & toggle button)
  bugfix: call removeListener() only for disconnected client instead of removing all listeners
  
  Anyway..
  Is it actually possible to use the 0.5 version?
  What version of Message should I use?
  
  Cheers
