  you sure you tried this combination with v0.3: 
  * nodejs 0.10.12 
  * vvvv b30.2 + addonpack
  
  if <span class="node">ShellExecute (Windows Advanced)</span> is red that sounds like you're missing the addonpack. 
  
  hardcoding your ip into the sourcecode should not be necessary. see the section in the patch where <span class="node">IP (Network)</span> returns your local IP. there may be a missmatch there...
