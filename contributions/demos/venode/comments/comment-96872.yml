  Any idea how to get a URL parameter like:
  
  http://localhost:8000/?id=1234
  
  passed as the "Interaction Data" on the NewClient message?
  
  I tried looking at request.url in the httpServer in server.js, but all it gives is some ajax .gif file.  This is all new stuff to me, but I hacked away anyway.  Here's what I tried:
  
  ```
  var requrl = "";
  
  var httpServer = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  	requrl = request.url;
      request.addListener('end', function () {
          clientFiles.serve(request, response);
      });
  });
  
  ...
  
  	var NewId = "NewCLient|" + requrl +"|"+  socket.id;
  		UdpSend(NewId,V4Ip,V4PortReceive)
  ```
  
  Which gives "NewCLient|/css/images/ajax-loader.gif|JaVjO2hO-Var71mqcUDb"
  
  How grossly am I off base here?  Thanks!
