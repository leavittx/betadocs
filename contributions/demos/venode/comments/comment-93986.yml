  i think i depends on the device and browser... , but since many people are on iphone i thought it was not very good to use that kind of stuff for public if you need fast interaction .
  for Ip i should update the patch and simply put 127.0.0.1, it was working fine before.. the car stuff was a bad idea , even using your select doesn't solve all issue...
