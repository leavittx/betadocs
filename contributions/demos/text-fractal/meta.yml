  The core of this patch is a little subpatch called find_nearest. it takes a number of positions and scalings and a new position and aspect. from that it checks if the position isn't inside a rectangle and then calculates a new rectangle on that position which touches the nearest rectangle and has the given aspect.
  
  there is also a 3d version of it, that took me years to find, but the visual output isn't as cool as i expected. but write me if you need it.
