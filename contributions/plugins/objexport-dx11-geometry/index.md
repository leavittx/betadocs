## 3d Export your generative geometry with subsets to any 3d modelling software.
Comes in two flavors:
* OBJExport (DX11.Geometry) exports vertices, normals, texcoords, subsets, 
* Writer (OBJ Point) exports points color stored to normal

Might not work if mesh has no vertices, normals, texcoords...

Now supports mesh spreading by transform or texture transform by (unc)

if you can't see your mesh in vvvv, put that in to packs/dx11/core
