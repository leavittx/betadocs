somehow you have a linear path from somewhere, consisting of just too much coordinates ? you want to find the corners of the path ?

then this plugin is for you

- finds corners in a two-dimensional path
- helps to reduce spreadcounts of paths 
- set of parametes : KernelSize, Standard Deviation, Threshold
- Debug Output can show angle detection, smoothed angle etc.
- additional relative position allows to move object on path
- released as dynamic plugin, feel free to modify and contribute
