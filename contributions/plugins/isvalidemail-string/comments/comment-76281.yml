  hey bjoern, thank you for the contrib!
  may i suggest 2 improovements?
  1/ validate via root zones http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ (avoid locals, but only classic latin), 
  since test@domainname.rus marked now as valid but it's not
  test@domainname.ru is valid
  2/ let more flexible names 
  e.g. (_@domainname.com) now marked as not valid, but it is. i know, google not let to use signs, but some other services do, so _ and - sings should be welcome in the plug filters.
