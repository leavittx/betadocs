This Pixelshader simulates a digital glitch on the GPU.
It has 5 different distortions layed on top of each other and meltet randomly.

I simply tweaked ,added some FX to enrich the picture in more different ways and for now - i enjoy the results and hope that it might be usefull to someone.
Playing around with glitches became a hobby to me. Maybe someone wants to join and help improving.
