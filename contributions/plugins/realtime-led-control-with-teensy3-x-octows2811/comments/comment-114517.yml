  @velcrome: sorry for the delay. Today I tested your new version. For me nothing is changed from the previous module version. I have the same feedback. Half matrix working and blinking leds. I saw also that <span class="pin">TeensyCount</span> is not connected so the module is no longer spreadable for control multiple Teensy.
