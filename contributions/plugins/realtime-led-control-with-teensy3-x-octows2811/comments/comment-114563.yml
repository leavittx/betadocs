  Yes, I did. :( I'm working with a 28x16 led matrix attached to Teensy with 56 leds per 8 strips with led layout 1. Parameters in the firmware are:
  
  ```
  LED_WIDTH      28   
  LED_HEIGHT     16
  LED_LAYOUT     1
  
  VIDEO_XOFFSET  0
  VIDEO_YOFFSET  0  
  VIDEO_WIDTH    100
  VIDEO_HEIGHT   100
  ```
  
  As code says "ledsPerStrip = LED_WIDTH * LED_HEIGHT / 8;"
  
  As your OctoWS2811 (RS232) help patch I send to the module a spread of 448 colors, <span class="pin">LED StripLenght</span> set to 56 and <span class="pin">PinCount</span> to 8.
  
  Where am I wrong?
  
  P.S. Would be great if we could spread <span class="pin">StripLenght</span> with different values to control different Matrix setups on different Teensy (always with <span class="pin">PinCount</span> set to 8 as OctoWS2811 conventions). I don't know if it is possible.
