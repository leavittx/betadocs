  Heres a sketch for 4 outputs via art net using fastLED, I've recently got 7 working with octoWS via art net, using the example in the teensy WS examples.
  I'll try and work out if I can get more universe from fastLED soon hopefully.
  I use the DMX(artnet) node and set the IP to the controller you want to control (this means changing it per teensy if your using multiples) you need 1 per universe.
  1 Universe will control 170pixels
