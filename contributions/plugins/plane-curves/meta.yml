  A curve is a continous function that outputs two coordinates.
  
  The easiest way to describe a continous curve is the following:
  
  take a pencil and a paper and draw without separate the pencil from the paper ... that is a continuous curve.
  
  UPDATE> this contribution was created some time ago, when VVVV used to scan the plugins/ folder. Nowadays, just unzip it, copy the PlaneCurves folder in your contribution/plugins folder and restart VVVV or rescan for external. Then if you open the _root_PlaneCurves.v4p patch you should see the "heart" curve, and all plugins will be in your nodelist.
