  hey guys,
  sorry, i was busy with other things. PWM not working is interesting. Please make sure you have the Standrad Firmata 2.2 uploaded to the board; there is a new version of Firmata in the making, but might break some functionality of old Firmata related code – just that you know. Try to reset after you changed the modes (should actually not be necessary).
  
  Just a general note for clarity. The module that comes with the plugin is for a "standard" Arduino with Standard Firmata (e.g Uno, Duemilanove, Diecilema, etc.) – so special Firmata like the one for the Mega are likely to break some functions. That is why it is just called <span class="node">Arduino</span>. An <span class="node">ArduinoMega</span> would be very nice, as well as a Nano, etc. Send me a Mega and i am happy to fix the issues and patch a module :)
  The roadmap for the 1.x Version of the plugin is to fully support all Firmata features (PWM, I2C, etc) on a "standard" Firmata. So all are welcome to contribute code, fixes and issues.
