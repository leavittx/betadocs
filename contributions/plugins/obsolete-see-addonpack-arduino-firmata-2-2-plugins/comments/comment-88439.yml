  you can set the number of inputs and outputs with firmataEncode and firmataDecode via the inspektor. the spreadcount of inputsettings should reflect your I/O settings. 
  
  remember, the plugins are versatile tools to communicate with any firmata protocol enabled device. you just have to set them up to the right number of I/O's.
  
  someone in the forum already did the settings for the mega, i can't remember who .... just do a search.
