  r u using the encoder node directly or the Arduino node?
  check the Inspector. there you can set the number of pins on your board.
  the Arduino module itself limits this to 20 in sum.
  
  if u r using the module try the encoder/decoder directly. check the omodule on how they used.
  
  note to self: .... damn, i have to get those help patches done...
