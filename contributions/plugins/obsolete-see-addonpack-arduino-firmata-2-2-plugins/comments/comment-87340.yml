  hi tom64,
  well, it has been some struggle to get the right encoding for the data, as vvvv does not really support *byte* as a value type. internally the plugin packs/unpacks the bytes as an ANSI string; but i can hardly imagine this causes the problem.
  
  could you test this behaviour with the rs-232 node alone?
