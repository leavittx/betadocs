  Some of you might know the [ArcLength](xref:contribution/arclength(3d-generic)) module. It's very nice because it's able to place points at specified distances along a spline.
  
  Unfortunately, it's not spreadable (some of the nodes needed for this don't have general purpose, use- and meaningful spreadable implementations).
  
  Thus here I present to you PathVectors (3d), rewritten as plugin, spreadable, binsizeable and fast.
  
  You basically input a spread of splines and a spread of percentages at which to place new points. See the help patch for different usecases.
