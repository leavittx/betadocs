  nice one ! very useful for GUI control on machines with no directx.
  
  feedback:
  
  - naming it group instead of cons would be more vvvv compliant
  - add option to add scrollbars to renderer and textbox
  - add default text/reset pin to textbox
  
  - and maybe make it a dynamic plugin hence other ppl can contribute to the code
  
  cheers
