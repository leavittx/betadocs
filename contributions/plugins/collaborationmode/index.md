This node is made for a joyful experience with your friend.
It's like boygrouping but for coders :)

###  How to use it
For connection on both sides  your must:
* Set IP & port pins to server (one of your) IP & port
* Disable the firewall (or add this port to exceptions list)

###  Some restrictions
* You can't see creation of links and their movements (only final result)
* Your collaborator must have the same addonpacks and plugins
* Subpatches not supported (yet)
* Only for two coders

###  Update
**v1.3**
* Fix replacing nodes
* Use separate history

**v1.2**
* Fixed small bug (selection deleted nodes when update came from other side)

**v1.1**
* Bug fixes and code cleanup
