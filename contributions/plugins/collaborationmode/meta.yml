  This node is made for a joyful experience with your friend.
  It's like boygrouping but for coders :)
  
  ###  How to use it
  
  For connection on both sides  your must:
  * Set IP & port pins to server (one of your) IP & port
  * Disable the firewall (or add this port to exceptions list)
  
  ###  Some restrictions
  
  * You can't see creation of links and their movements (only final result)
  * Your collaborator must have the same addonpacks and plugins
  * Subpatches not supported (yet)
  * Only for two coders
  
  ###  Update

  * Use separate history
  
  **v1.2**
  * Fixed small bug (selection deleted nodes when update came from other side)
  
  **v1.1**
  * Bug fixes and code cleanup
