  I'm afraid I don't speak russian and have no idea if it would work with this plugin. The thing to keep in mind is that this plugin is expecting a ftdi usb adapter. If the controller that you posted utilizes such a chip for rs485 conversion, then the chances are high that it works! But again, I have no idea about that specific controller...
