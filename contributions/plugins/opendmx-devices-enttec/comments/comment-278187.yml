  Hi
  It's working perfect in beta, but I'm still cannot get correct result by pure serial.
  Is this https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Devices.ENTTEC working differently?
  Is there a way to implement it in gamma? I spotted that this plugin uses FTD2XX library and is this a thing?
  
  upd: I got the library from https://ftdichip.com/software-examples/code-examples/csharp-examples/ and realised what the difference
