  Thanks Woei.. Really appreciated.
  
  Just a little question... It is possible to avoid the update pin, so every new patch has the color of the root.v4p (where I placed your node)?
  
  *Nothing fancy, just set the value @80 to have a darker background for my eyes.*
  *(For me 80 is the limit under which the node color and the link interfere with eachother.) *
  
  Tryed to delete the IF and obviously strange thighs happened.
  
  Can you also access links color?
  (like CTRL+H does)
  
  Thanks bye
