  @robe: you could just connect a toggle to the update pin instead of the default bang. should do the trick. 
  although you might not want to have the plugin crawl your whole project every frame to set the color. that's why there's an update pin.
  
  the link color is set implicitly by changing it to hiddenwhenlocked mode. didn't find a way to explicitly set the color.
