  @[catweasel](http://vvvv.org/users/catweasel):
  I've tried on my optimus laptop, and it works here.
  
  Are you using beta32 ?
  
  If yes, from beta32 dx9ex is the default, and I never managed to use Elliot's Blackmagic contrib in dx9ex mode ( see posts before ).
  
  To have it working with beta32 I had to start with dx9 flag at startup.
  Also in the YUV2RGB I had to change format in the DX9texture to A8R8G8B8 .
  
  I hope this helps.
