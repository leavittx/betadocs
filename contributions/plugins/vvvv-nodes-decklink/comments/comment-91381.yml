  One more issue: it seems like it can t write to 2 heads at the same time, like one head is fine, the other the frame rate is extremely low.
  DEBUG INFO : setting the /dda to the head which gives problems seems to fix it, still on the offending render I can see a huge spurge of rendering time (in debug mode) at consistent intervals.
