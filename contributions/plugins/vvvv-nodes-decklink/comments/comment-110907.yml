  i'd be really up for doing a crowd-lanced* stage of development on this, where people pitch in requests.
  (crowd-lanced = freelance + crowd funded. yeah..., i don't think this name is going to take off)
  
  So far I'm thinking:
  * DX11 support
  * DX9ex support + testing
  * DX9 textures on multi-head testing + fixes
  * 64bit support
  
  There's a few features I can't release right now as their development is ongoing with private funding.
  
  If anybody is interested, then please email me directly
