  @eno - i'm going via cpu but the load is very low in testing (partly because of the YUV scenario). 
  I'm using the BlackMagic SDK directly (not via WDM).
  
  I don't know of any way of shipping the pixels direct across the PCIe bus using this framegrabber. Afaik, that is only possible with the Qaudro SDI capture solution*, but i'd certainly love to be proven wrong about that.
