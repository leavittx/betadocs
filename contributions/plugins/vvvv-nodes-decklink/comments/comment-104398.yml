  My source video its a sony cx12 1080i connected by HDMI
  
  bmdMode HD1080p2997 works fine, videoimputflagdefault, no interlace, but i have 2 images 1 over the second one
  like a 3d stream... so im cropping the top one
  (the top one works 1/2 frame latter than the buton one ),,, this is with mainloop at 60fps
  so im cropping the button one to get my 1080p video working fine,,, but it will be half resolution on Y axys
  
  the other mode that works its bmdModeHD1080i5994 but with a heavy heavy interlaced effect
  funny thing,,, Media Express works just fine under the same setting 1080i59.94... no delay, no interlaced.
  
  this is my camera, but i will be using it with 50i cameras,,, 50p works just fine, but with the interlace i have thar issue
  
  on the other hand, i connected the hdmi out of my gx670 to the intensity pro...
  and i was able to get the image on this mode Hd1080i6000 but with fliks and interlaced..
  on 1080p30 i get the same as before, 2 streams one over eachother, and if i crop them, it works fine... but it doest look rigth....
  all this is on vvvv
  
  On media Express 1080i60 it seems to works fine... but on 4v this doest work fine,,,
  
  workarround on this ?
  
  im plaing to convert the signal from the video mixer (sdi) to hdmi, put it in a kramer video unit, and reconvert it to any format that vvvv handles rigth
  
  what are the setting that you guys used ? 
  
  
  Pd i made a simple test... my camera pointing at mi screen1, there i have lfo running and a mainloop countinf frames, with a mainloop on 30fps, on the screen2 its the output of the blackmagic,,, i recoreded everything with a go pro hero3 at 240fps to get this frame http://postimg.org/image/wyrh0lqnb/
  
  it seems 4 frames delay, 166ms,,, this is the minimun delay possible ?
