  I'm getting a green output on my laptop, (optimus) I've turned off clip device, and set the dx texture to all available options, but it never gives the input source, just various colours depending on the texture format. I have tested in Media Express.
  Anyone have a solution [keftaparty](http://vvvv.org/users/keftaparty) maybe?
