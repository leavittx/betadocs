  @newemka - if you have the 2 cards, can you try with GetSlice on output of the ListDevices node onto the input of the VideoIn node. This should work in theory but I haven't been able to test so far.
  
  Ah, you mean the actual physical inputs. 
  Hmm..interesting.
  This would be in the API. I'll have a look when I'm next inside that plugin.
