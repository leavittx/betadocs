  Ok after several tests this i what i found...
  50i works with a interlaced effect,,, i tested 2 cameras, and its the same
  i even use a tvone c2-7000 to send specific resolution and test the all...
  so... workarround 1:
  set up the blackmagic as hd1080p 25 and stretch the frame. This give me no delay at all, only 3 frames, same as BlackMagic Media Express
  
  workaround 2:  manuel gave me the idea of using BOBdeinterlace shader. so I set up the blackmagic in hd1080i50 and tested again...
  this seems to work, sometimes it add 1 frame delay, but works... but,,, it didt look good
  
  so i took a screenshot of each aproach, the image its croped, but its 1:1 pixel. The camera its a Sony NX5N set up in 1080i/576i... this are the results
