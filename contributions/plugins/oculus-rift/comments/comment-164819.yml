  I still don't get how you guys are correcting the distortion. I see that in the new SDK the distortion happens using a mesh rather than pixel shader as before, so there aren't any distortion coefficients.
  
  In the absence of that data from the SDK are you manually tweaking the DistKXYZW values?
