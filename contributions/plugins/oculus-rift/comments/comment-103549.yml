  Yes jannis, I have seen that too.  Seems to only happen a few times when I first start using it, and then doesn't again.  Also only seen it happen on one machine of two I've tried it on (oddly the faster one).
  
  This plugin I believe is using an older version of the Rift SDK; updating may fix it but not sure what's required to do that.
  
  @Herbst: there are two different "OculusPlugin.dll" files in the zip file, one in the base folder, and another (newer) down in the plugins\DevicesOVRDevice\bin\Dynamic folder.  Wasup wid dat? (;^})  Thanks!
