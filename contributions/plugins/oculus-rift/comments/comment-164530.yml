  So last plugin (TidenBarn's) is working for me, but I've got a strange behaviour.
  If face forward and then rotate the head up, down, left and right; all camera rotations are correct. 
  But if I turn my head 90Â° right (or left) and then look up or down, camera rotation is all wrong.
  Why is this happen? Please help
