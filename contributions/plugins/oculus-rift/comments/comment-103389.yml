  The original patch was just missing the eye perspective shifts (and the right eye orientation) - it had the image shift to compensate for the Rift display, but that's a 2D shift of the overall image.  The "camera" of the two generated eye renders need to be separated in local X position by the interocular (interpupillary) distance as well.  The wrong connections were in my first addition to add the perspective shift.
  
  I'm not suggesting I did it the right way in this "fix", but I do have "correct" (;^}) stereoscopic patches which work very well with my VR wall, and I'll add those in once I get them checked out.
  
  Your work here really is a great help, I was able to get up and running in a couple of hours.  Now I need to figure out how to make the Rift wireless!
