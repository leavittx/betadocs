  Any ideas on why if i put more than two pictures on the xml file it doesn't pick them up?
  
  the code is the same..copy - paste..
  
  edit...
  
  OK...It's picking up more than 2 pictures...the problem before seems to be that the third picture that I was trying to track was just a green rectangle..It seems that it doesn't pick up just a plain color...Bright and colorfull pictures are easier to track.
