  hey,
  unfortunately metaio SDK cannot use for any commercial project no more. because they stopped sdk download & selling licenses.
  
  metaio plugin itself works no problem if you installed sdk.
  
  so i'd like to keep this page and support personally until receive warning from apple;)
  please send message to me if you want to get sdk installer. (or get from Steryl's link?)
  
  also try to find other AR SDK...
