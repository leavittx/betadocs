  Hey, 
  
  first of al thank you mino for your contribution. It works great! 
  I have been using metaio for about a month now and trying out a few things for my school project. 
  
  Two days ago i ran into a problem, that the metaio.help wont show my webcam in vvvv. 
  InstantTracking.help still works, but all the patches that have the Metaio Node dont show my webcam image and instead a black screen. The strange thing is that it worked a couple of days ago.
  
  I tried so many things. (1) Deleted all the changes i made to the patch since the problem (2) reinstalled the metaio SDK (3) reinstalled vvvv (4) tried on a different computer. Nothing has helped and i badly need it to work for my final project. 
  
  Did anyone experience something similar? Would appreciate if anyone could help me out here!
