  ok, i had flickering on my macbook pro running xp32. now i tried on a desktop machine with xp32 and i have no flickering. what i did different is using the existing windrvr6.sys while installing the driver. i received the message that the existing windrvr6.sys is newer than the one coming with the driver. 
  
  either using the desktop machine fixed the problem or using the existing windrvr6.sys fixed the problem. i can't tell...
