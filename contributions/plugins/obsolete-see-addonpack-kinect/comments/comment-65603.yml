  thanks for developing! works nice and stable :)
  
  can anyone give me a hint how to remove the background? I only need the objects (people) walking in a distance from 1-3 metres.
  
  I just copied the nodes from the HeightField example to get a picture without background by using the Terrain effect from Terrain.fx
  it draws the person in black just like I need it :)
  
  now the problem is, that it only draws the person to a distance max of about 1 metre, nothing behind that point.
  
  I cant figure out how to solve this or where to change the Terrain.fx
  
  thanks for any help!
  felix
