  Ok launch error is fixed. Was just a little thread status in the wrong order, so could have a status check error when having complex patches.
  
  Seems start/stop is quite faster as well somehow.
  
  About the fullscreen switch, doesn't happen here at all (single/dual screen). Anyone else got the same problem?
  
  Update probably later in the day.
