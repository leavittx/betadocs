  Hello evvvverybody,
  
  Trying to save some time for newcomers: I tried every possible solution (different USB ports, drivers, .dll changes) and finally got the Kinect working only after using the 'old' drivers (link given by RicardoCastelhano).
  I just have some flickering (otherwise, everything is OK). Actually after using the 'old' drivers, even the CLNUIDevice Test got totally stable. :-)
  Thumbs up to both vux and the community for sharing the knowledge.
