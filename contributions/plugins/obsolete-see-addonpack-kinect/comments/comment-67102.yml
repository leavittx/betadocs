  This plugin seems to not work for me about half the time (mostly when I have a vvvv patch with lots of shaders).  It just either gives me a starting or error message and never provides a depth or color image.  Anyone else experiencing this?
  
  I am using the CLNUI drivers 1.0.0.1121.
  
  Also, is the source available for this plugin?  I would love to take a look at it and see if I can fix the issues I am seeing.
  
  Many Thanks,
  joel
