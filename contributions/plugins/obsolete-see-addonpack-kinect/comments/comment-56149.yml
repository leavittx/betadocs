  hey cool, thank you vux. But I had the same problems as aze. CLUINDevicetest works fine, Kinect node gives only an error. Copied both dlls of the zip.
  
  Solution: I copied the CLNUIDevice.dll out of my CL NUI Platform installation (CL NUI Platform\SDK\Bin\CLNUIDevice.dll) to vvvv plugins... and it works fine. Perhaps different version?
