  First release for Kinect Plugin.
  
  You need alexp's driver to be able to run it, hopefully moving to the open source ones soon.

  Should be pretty stable, only bug i could not fix (seems a driver problem), DO NOT unplug your kinect while the patch is running.
  
  Copy the two dlls in the plugin folder and you set.
  
  Comes with couple of examples.
  
  Fully threaded, so it doesnt block vvvv, and a nice pull/push api for adding some extra image processing, too tired for writing the samples, will come soon.
  
  Have fun in the mean time :)
