gFantasticReader:
Dynamic plugin that parses Touch actions from Fantastick.

Note: There is a constant in the plugin called MAX_TOUCHES. The default is 5. If you need to detect more than 5 touches simultaneously modify this constant and recompile the plugin.

Last Update: 05.02.11
 - added pins to let you easily listen for a specific command
