  confirm exception. placing FeralTic.dll into the plugins dir does not help.
  
  with beta31.2 i can see colored quads, more recent x86 versions don't even do that. no editing possible :(
  
  where did you keep the plugin while developing?
  
  if it's meant to be #fun why not opensource it? maybe someone even fixes you up with an x64 :P
