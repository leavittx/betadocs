  This is an example from the *Working with the vvvv-sdk* workshop at [node13](http://node13.vvvv.org).
  
  The example was chosen to demonstrate the steps necessary to include a thirdparty managed dependency in a plugin, ie:
  * use ProjectExplorer (Ctrl+j) to add a reference to the managed assembly
  * add the namespace to the *using* section of the plugin
  
  The plugin simply takes a .wav file and plays it back. This should also be a good starting point for more advanced usage of [NAudio](http://naudio.codeplex.com)s capabilities.
  
  Note: This example requires an ASIO driver for your sound card. In case you don't have one, get it from: http://www.asio4all.com
