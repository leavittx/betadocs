  gentlemen, there is wrong dependencies in the plugin. thats why for some it works, but for other - it isn't.
  we have no resources to fix it now/soon
  sorry for that.
  
  please use sources from algs github page to fix it by youself https://github.com/smakhtin/DrawSmooth
  
  or ask alg if he will find time for this
  
  thank you for understanding and patience
