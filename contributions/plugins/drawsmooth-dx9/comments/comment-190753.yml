  Weird. I'm running the same V4-version + the same OS-versions here - > the pillow texture is visible, but no drawing.  No complaints in TTY.
  (Win8.1, multiple versions 33.7 down to 32 - in 64 and 32 bit versions, Optimus hardware (!)) 
  
  My other machine (Win7/64, b33.7_x86 plus any other version) plays the help-patch as expected.
