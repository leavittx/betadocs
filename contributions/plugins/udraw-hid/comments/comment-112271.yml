  Finally got 2 uDraw tablets, but not having any luck to get them to work in vvvv. I am using the help file, but in Device Type it always just shows "Undefined" as the only option.
  
  The tablet works with the application from http://brandonw.net/udraw/. I have restarted and tried everything i know of with no luck. I can see in your screenshot it actually says "THQ uDraw Game Tablet for PS3" for device. In device manager of windows its just shown as "HID-compliant game controller" however. Did you install some sort of driver?
  
  Thank you!
