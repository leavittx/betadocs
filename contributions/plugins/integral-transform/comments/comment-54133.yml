  You have to put the content of the folder in:
   vvvv_45beta24\plugins\Integral\ 
  Depending how you unzip your folder youmight need to create the integral folder.
  and the dll will be created automatiquely at start.
  Note it's only compatible with beta24 and the plugin will not work outside the plugin folder.
