  A question: What parts of this has landed in the addonpack? I have installed current vvvv and addonpack, and some nodes are already there before adding the christmas pack, e.g. MulitFlipFlop (Animation Advanced), so I'd get duplicate node entries.
  Is there a version which removed the duplicates, or did I do something wrong?
