  Hi dipboing,
  
  thank you for your feedback.
  
  I noticed there was some cached .NET stuff in dynamic plugin folders.
  
  It should be fixed in version 1.1.1 (just uploaded right now).
  
  If not, please contact me via chat to help me understand better what is the problem: I am casati.gianluca on skype and gtalk.
  
  Ciaooooo
