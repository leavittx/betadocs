  Hey Evvvvil!
  
  Thanks for the great contrib.
  
  TweetSearch is working without problems for me. I'm having trouble with the TweetLogger and TweetAction.
  
  Trying to login as dev first works, when klicking Refresh Login Status it says Logged In, but trying again after a few seconds says Not logged in any more.
  
  TweetAction always sais Failed! Tweet was not published
  
  Any ideas how to debug?
