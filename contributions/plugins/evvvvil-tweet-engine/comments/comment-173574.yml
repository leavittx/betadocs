  Thankx guys much appreciated, hope the plugin is at least as massive as that kid in the picture ;) 
  Yeah the tutorial is bit long but covers everything even how to create twitter application as you've seen, which is pretty basic, but can get confusing for non tweet-heads, what tokens are etc... Anyway thankx a lot hope you find it useful and feel free to report any bug or new feature requests I am open to make this even better.
  
  PLEASE NOTE: If you are replying in batch to many tweets then the time interval should be pretty high and make sure you have a lot of possible randomize replies because, well I just  got banned AGAIN yesterday at 5 seconds interval without randomize though, for replying to 50 tweets. You basically start getting "FAILED!..." after about 15 replies... It would be nice if you guys could let me know how it works for you as it's hard to test. I will do further testing but last time I checked I was banned from replying again. lol this a lot of fun though :)
  
  It would be nice to find out what the machine gun mode time interval should be for replying in batch, seems for the rest it's fine to keep it low but replying is a bitch...
  
  Anyway peace :)
