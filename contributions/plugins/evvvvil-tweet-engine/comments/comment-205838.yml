  hey @evvvvil , I keep getting bad credential messages, both with dev and normal authorization, there's a new "Enable callback locking" button in the app details tab, tried enabling and disabling it but the same happens.  Tried with both vvvv_45beta34.1_x86 and _x64
   
  Not sure where to look for more information, When I open EvvvvilTweetEngine_example.v4p there's a nasty couldn't divide by zero there as soon as I open the patch (I've attached the tty Renderer output), but it doesn't appears when I open EvvvvilTweetEngine.v4p, I still get the Bad consumer key or secret, monsieur tete de bite.

  Should I get a mullet? :o
  
  update: Well, I should get half a mullet, tried it with vvvv45_beta33.7_x86 in win8.1 and worked GREAT, seems to fail in win10.
