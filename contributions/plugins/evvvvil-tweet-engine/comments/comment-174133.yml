  @evvvvil: great plugin and even better tutorial!
  
  also, thanks for all that information on threading! Have you maybe also got information/example code which you can share on threading functions which need parameters:
  
  eg 
  DoSomething (int param1, int param2){
  .....
  }
  
  afaik it should be done with a lambda expression then, but i can't get it to work: [threaded-generic-nodes-big-integer-data-type](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/threaded-generic-nodes-big-integer-data-type)
  
  any hints much appreciated, thanks in advance!
