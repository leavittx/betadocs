Evvvvil Tweet Engine brings most of the Twitter REST API to vvvv. Authorize, search, publish, favourite or retweet tweets and even spam twitter with batch actions that can send hundreds of tweets in one click. Other cool features include: geo localised search, time interval search, posting with pictures or geo coordinates, reply to tweets, destroy tweets, etc... 

Please watch this tutorial video to learn how to use this Twitter engine:

Plugin written by evvvvil in C# with the TweetINVI API.

Changes since the video has been made:
-Cancel search action button added so you can cancel if search is taking too long
-All actions are finished bang, so you can know when all the batch actions have been done, not just each individual action.

Upcoming features:
-Add a failed action bang to let you know when an action has failed, not just been done.

Feel free to use my website and callback url when creating your application:

Please report any bugs or new feature requests on this page.

Keep it gritty, evvvvil.
