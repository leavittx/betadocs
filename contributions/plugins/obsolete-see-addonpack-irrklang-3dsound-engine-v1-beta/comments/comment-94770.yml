  That's not possible with the plugin.
  I think it's better to use ableton to output sound directly maybe with the help of maxforlive to deal with 3d .
  But without maxforlive you can  do a patch to calculate distance between object and camera , then send this distance to ableton with midi to control the volume of each tracks , if you want to add the rolloff effect i guess it is just a frequency filter that you can do in ableton.
