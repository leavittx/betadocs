  It's still not working for me.
  There must be some detail I am overlooking cause I tried it on two computers now with the same result. Red irrklang node with the following message when i move the cursor over it: "Irrklang (sound 1) is missing. (Irrklang.csproj <id%20122>"
  
  Are there any other things besides .NET that have to be installed?
