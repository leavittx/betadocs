  with beta25 works for me if i just put the Irrklang directory as is on my Desktop and ignore what is mentioned in the install.txt (was only necessary for beta24). 
  now open the patch, set the Irrklang nodes device enum to "default device" (that should really be fixed in the patch. sanch?) and press "stop all", then "play sound".
