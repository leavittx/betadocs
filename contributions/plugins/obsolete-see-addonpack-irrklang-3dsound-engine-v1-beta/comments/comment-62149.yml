  Actually autoselected driver is directsound8, tried to switch it manually but doenst work, thank u for pointing us on forum, from what i (fastly) searched :
  
  1) on mac is impossible to have e real 3d (but...is mac so :)
  2) on windows it looks like there are not so much info and some users published the same problems, some workaround, maybe a solution tricking on driver settings, was not so clear finally.
  
  Anyway we switched audio activity on reaktor
