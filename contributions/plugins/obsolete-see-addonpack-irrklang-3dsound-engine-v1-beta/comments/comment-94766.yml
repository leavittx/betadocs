  ive just tested this plugin and its quite amazing! Is there a way to get ableton live's audio output working with this? Would it work with 8mono output Soundcard?
  
  The idea would be to get ~4-12 different audio layers from ableton live via some virtual audio cable tool and then create 4-12 local radio streams to files from each and opening them with the plugin. 
  
  Would this be even possible? would someone have any advise on sofware to create the radio streams?
  
  Or is there any other ways to create 3d audio experiences based on vvvv position data in other seperate audio engines that can use directshow/line in audio?
