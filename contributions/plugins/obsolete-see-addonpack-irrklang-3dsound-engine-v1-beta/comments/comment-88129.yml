  I'm looking at using this in some other projects but having a few problems getting it running on 28.1, IrrKlang isn't placing sounds correctly in the space. I think the problem's just happening because somehow the 'View Position XYZ' and 'View Direction XYZ' pins are only accepting a single vector as input. They should be using 3d vector inputs, Inspektor shows a single value even when sending a spread of 3.
  
  Does anyone with a bit more plugin know-how know how to fix this? I would be very grateful!
