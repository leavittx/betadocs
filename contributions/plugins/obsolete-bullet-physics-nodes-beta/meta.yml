  Bullet physics nodes first release.
  
  Still beta, but fairly stable. Some breaking changes are to be expected in upcoming releases.
  
  Work on beta 25+ only (Latest version for beta26)
  
  Still on the todo list:
  * Mesh system doesn't work for multi-screen yet. First thing which will be sorted.
  * Review the mesh system to improve performance.
  * Texturing options for some shapes (soft bodies and stuff like hulls).
  * Missing some shape types.
  * Add body 2 body contraints
  * Vehicles
  * Clustered soft bodies
  * Fix any bug that comes around.
  
  In the mean time, have fun.
  
  Latest fixes/update:
  -Soft body meshes have normals.
  -Update Position/Rotation for Rigid bodies.
