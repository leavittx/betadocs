  -Rigid Shapes now have custom string.
  -New node: GetRigidShapeDetails.
  -Collision Objects can now have a second arbitrary object as custom pin (must implement ICloneable).
  -CreateRigidBody/UpdateRigidBody now features Allow Sleep/Is Active option
  -CreateBody also features Static/Kinematic flag.
  -CreateRigidBody (Persist version) was not cleaning list on world reset.
