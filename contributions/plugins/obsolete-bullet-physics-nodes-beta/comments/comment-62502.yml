  Hello, Mr Vux,
  
  I wanted to let you know about something I experienced while experimenting with the Bullet Physics nodes a week ago.
  
  I created an inert box to act as the ground surface. It was kind of pizza-box shaped, meaning it was rather flat. If I drop another object from a fairly high position, I would expect it to bounce back up, when it hits the box, but it would fall through it.
  
  Now it seems to me that for collision detection, you use the current position of an object, to see if it intersects with another object. The problem is - because the calculations are inherently discrete - that if an object has a high velocity, the next calculated position might be at the other side of the object. So I think one should check if the line between previous position and current position intersects with another object. If it does, the 2 objects collide.
  
  Anyway, that's what I suspect to be the reason of this unexpected behaviour.
  
  Cheers.
