  hi soundreactor! 
  
  Thanks for the serious plugins. It seems like they changed a little bit the Access Token answer. I updated this and then it worked.
  
  But shouldn't tweets also work?
  
  https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/update
  
  I cannot get it to work. Do you know what could be wrong?
  
  I uploaded the updated, working patch with the open question here [post-tweets-with-twitter-api](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/post-tweets-with-twitter-api)
  
  
  cheers
