  Again, this is so simple I'm not sure it hadn't existed before. Yet, here it is.
  This let's you click/press and drag one or more values depending on one or more buttons.
  
  Have fun, I made two versions, a *binary* version and a *dynamic/source-code* version. Whichever you like best. Personally I'm a fan of binaries so that's why you get that version. If anyone would have a look at my code and give me tips that'd be great :)
  
  
  Future versions might include the "apple feature" a.k.a. inertia-based dragging.
  
  /edit: better helppatch now
