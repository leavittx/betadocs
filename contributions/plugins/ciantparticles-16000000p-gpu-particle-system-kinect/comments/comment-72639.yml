  Help file Strawman is just a more complicated version of the other files .. that's weird. Try this less computationally expensive version of that more complicated file: <kivi.tym.cz/upload/StrawmanSimplified.zip> (and press 'R' reset few times)
  or .. have you tried turning your computer off and on again? :)
  
  Your graphic cards are definitely good enough, maybe after more people write here, we will be able to see the problem.
