  Glad to hear you still know about this contribution. I'm preparing a big update with new functions. But it still needs some big corrections.
  
  About the Kinect Implement: This part is really marginal. You can use actual OpenNI SDK or Vux's Microsoft's SDK to get depth and rgb texture. It's only a picture. The rest in the patch is just a linear interpolation of points, not important.
