  @robe , yeah this kinect implementation is not working anymore , i managed to change the nodes CiantKinectImplement.v4p and see something but overall you just have to change too many nodes to make it work properly . 
  it may also be due to my total noobness in vvvv but yeah ... will be great if Martin can rework the patches with either the new modules in b27 , they work very well so far 
  @Martin - i did not mean to offend , just as a noobie i am finding it hard to rework it so i can see the efects
