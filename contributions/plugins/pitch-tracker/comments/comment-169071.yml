  in order to write a VAudio node you only need to code a signal which represents a slice and a node which handles the spreading. i think you can basically copy the FFT node sources:
  [FFTOutSignal.cs](https://github.com/tebjan/VVVV.Audio/blob/master/Source/VVVV.Audio.Signals/Sinks/FFTOutSignal.cs)
  [FFTOutNode.cs](https://github.com/tebjan/VVVV.Audio/blob/master/Source/VVVV.Audio.Nodes/Sinks/FFTOutNode.cs)
  
  you might have to change the double array to a PitchRecord and call SetLatestValue on the PitchDetected event...
