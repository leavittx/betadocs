Calculates pitch, midi note, midi cents, octave and note for your primary audio input.

Use case: Use your guitar for Rockband/Rocksmith type games in vvvv.

This project was created in the "Modulare Medienprogrammierung" (modular media programming) class at the University of Applied Sciences St. PÃ¶lten.

Future plans:
*) Selectable input
*) Source-agnostic (WAV file, microphone, ...)
