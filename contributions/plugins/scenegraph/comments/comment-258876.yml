  This is huge and provides a solution to a problem that's been a pain in vvvv, while environments like Unity offer way smoother and integrated asset handling/scene explorers.
  
  Exactly what I had in mind when writing this:
  https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/thirdparty-extensions/16387
  
  Still, it doesn't solve the problem that these approaches don't ship with vvvv/don't integrate well as there's no proper interface to load those modules up but to manually place them in your patch.
  
  Anyway, I very much welcome this. Finally something that aims to provide high level user friendliness.
  Just a couple of vvvv nuisances left in this regard. I will address this at the summer camp.
  
  Thank you!
