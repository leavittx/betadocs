  i used the middle mousebutton because i thought that is the last button you accidentally hit. but yeah, there should be undo / redo anyway. i need to do some housekeeping at some point to make this possible.
  
  on the other hand...
  
  one could argue that Automata UI follows the tradition of not having undo, just like timeliner ;)
