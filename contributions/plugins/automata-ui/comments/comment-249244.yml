  thanks for the flower.
  
  in terms of number of transitions, if you already have a route in one direction, why not use that for every case. like using „or“ outside of automata.
  not sure why you need an extra state here, sounds complicated.
  
  concerning the enums of transitions, thats just copy pasting microdees code, need to make the enum items unique. no big deal, will be fixed.
  
  edit: just realized there is more unfinished stuff in TriggerTransition, seems not spreadable in the way you would expect it to. will be fixed.
