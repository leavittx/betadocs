  Great timing! running through the source gave me some "oh no" moments but with some refactoring this thing could be made a great tool outside of vvvv too. If I were you I would have kept out spreads and vvvv from managing actual data and have the node only as a thin interfacing layer.
  I've already implemented seconds based timing and animation ;)
