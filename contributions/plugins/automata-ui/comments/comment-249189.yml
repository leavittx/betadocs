  @u7angel lucky you ::] in the world of constant fps 
  
  as for triggering, i mean quite simple behaviour:
  1) two states A/B with pingpong behaviour,
  2) two dedicated buttons A/B switching to corresponding state immediately.
  i.e. if i'm in A, <calling%20A> does nothing, <calling%20B> goes B, <waiting> goes B on timeout; same for B. 
  how to do that in your system?
