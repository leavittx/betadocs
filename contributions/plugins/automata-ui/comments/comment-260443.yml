  Hey Christian,
  excellent work :-)
  
  A feature-request from my side, for one of the next updates, would be an undo redo function and an alert warning if I want to delete a state or transition.
  If I hit the scrollwheelbutton accidentally over a state I lose the state, the connected transitions and my connections in the patch - would be cool to avoid that. ;-)
  
  Cheers
  David
