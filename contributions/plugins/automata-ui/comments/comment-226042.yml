  Thanks & Danke f√ºr die Blumen :)
  
  Did you use any library like [stateless](https://github.com/dotnet-state-machine/stateless/blob/master/README.md) for example or did you write the state machine from scratch? Anyway do you think it's feasible to extend the plugin to support [hierarchical state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#UML_extensions_to_the_traditional_FSM_formalism)?
