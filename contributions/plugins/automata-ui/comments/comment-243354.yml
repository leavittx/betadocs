  really super nice contribution! One question: is it also possible to implement non interactive states - like clicking from menu to submenu - will triggeer sequentiall three animation states between menu and submenu for animation purposes? let me know - it might be already possible and i just dont see it.
  
  or for instance a submenu state that once its clicked - automatically goes back to its previous state after locked time expired. so again it would be a framebased state change
  
  thank you again for the contribution! super nice
  
  best
