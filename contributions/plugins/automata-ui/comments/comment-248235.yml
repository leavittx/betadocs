  yo, finally I got to use this thing. Great work! But there are some slight nuances I might add if I were you:
  
  * Frame independent timing for transitions (maybe as a config pin option)
    maybe it's only my taste but I better like seconds or ms when I'm working with animations and transitions.
  * Trigger transitions off node
    In complex projects with lot's of different states and transitions it would be good to trigger transitions from different patches. I know this can lead to mayhem in the wrong hands but also would eliminate cobwebs or long ass unzipping on top of the AutomataUI node.
  
  that's it from the top of my head.
