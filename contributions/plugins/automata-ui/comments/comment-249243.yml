  i only see two transitions here.
  a to b
  b to a
  
  either can be triggered by a corresponding button and
  both by just one bang, handling the timeout in patch ie. monoflop, regtriggered by getstate )
  
  sounds to me you got confused by the pingpong transition. you dont need that. pingpong is for changes triggered by one button.
