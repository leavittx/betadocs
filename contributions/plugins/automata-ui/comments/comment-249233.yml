  @eps, and i'm not sure what you mean with timeout ? you want to trigger a transition in a delayed fashion ? maybe its easier to talk about your problem if you say what you are actually trying to achieve.
  
  what is the purpose of timeout and A/B pingpong stuff ? 
  what kind of interaction do you want to control ? 
  how would you visualize this in a graphical statemachine ?
