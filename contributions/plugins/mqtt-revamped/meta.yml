  based off the [mqtt sender and receiver](xref:contribution/mqtt-sender-receiver) plugins by [korriander](http://vvvv.org/users/korriander)
  v1.1 rewriting initiated and sponsored by <http://meso.net>
  
  
  this implementation comes in **two flavours**:
  ### MQTT (Network Client)
  
  monolithic Client node - for simple applications:
  a combined sender and receiver node (think rs232) since you most probably only specify the connection once
  
  ###  Client, Send and Receive
  
  do the client connection in one place of the patch and pass the client to the places, where sending and receiving is actually happening
  
  
  with following improvements:
  #### v1.1:
  
  * username and password
  * (Clean) Session
  * Keep Alive Period
  * Last Will / Testament
  * remove retained message
  * improved overall stability
