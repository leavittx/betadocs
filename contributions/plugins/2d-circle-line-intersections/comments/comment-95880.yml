  Hey Alg, i´m glad that you are interested on it.
  
  here there is a thread with some spreaded aproaches, 
  the Multiple line intersection plugin works without problems, but the circle circle version seems to be buggy.
  the Line Circle intersection doesn´t work for me, maybe you can take a look.
  
  [circle-line-intersect-plugin](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/circle-line-intersect-plugin)
  
  i´ll post it here the spreaded versions i have.
