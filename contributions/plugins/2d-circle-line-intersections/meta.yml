  Some dynamic plugins to calculate intersections between finite lines and circles.
  
  there are 3 cases:
  2 circles.
  circle - finite line.
  2 finite lines.
  
  It is also possible to transform the code for infinite line solutions.
  
  Update:
  Added Spreadable versions of 2 lines, and 2 circles intersection (still buggy).
  The Line Circle version is not yet spreadable.
