  * your class(es) were not inside a namespace
  ```
  namespace VVVV.Nodes.Tables
  {
    ... pluginclasses
  }
  ```
  works for me
  
  * since you have only one slice on the insert bang, the plugin resamples that for every incoming table. try setting on slicecount 2 and see.
  for each table on the input a bin of values, the index and the set boolean are used.
  
  check?
