  Nice!
  
  Some great new additions in here.
  I'm making this version the default for my own projects.
  
  a few issues:
  * Column Names is space delineated now? (e.g. "Position X (m), Position Y (m)" comes as 3 columns "Position", "X", "(m)". And everything after the first comma is then ignored.
  * Still has issue on repaint
  * checkbox (bool type) draws outside of bounds of row (maybe an issue on high dpi screens?)
  * Colours are kind of horrible now :(
  * GetColumn doesn't work with bool type? GetColumn (Dynamic) would be nice
  * GetRows (or simply GetRowIndices module which is a mix of Info and I (Spreads)) would be useful
