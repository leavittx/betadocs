  column names cannot have spaces, since their name will be used directly as xml node identifier. can handle that case more gracefully though
  </div>
  
  I see, interesting.
  I've changed my projects to use no spaces, but i think it'd be nice to have that support, and still comma separated lists would be more sensible (but now changing that would break old patches)

  repaint issue: indeed. seems even more noticeable now on win10 and highdpi. guess it would require quite a rework of event messaging...
  checkbox out of bounds: definitely high dpi issue, just noticed myself here
  </div>
  OK

  cheers!
  what **were** you thinking?? ;)

  GetColumn (Dynamic): the issue with that node would be, that it could change output pin (type) every time you change the index... therefore not implemented
  </div>
  Why would that be a problem?

  GetRows: you mean something like GetTable (Dynamic) a pin per column outputting all available cells?
  </div>
  yes exactly. would be nice!
