  Persistent data handling with GUI.
  
  Supports type boolean, int, float/double and string.
  
  Heavily based on VVVV.Nodes.TableBuffer by [elliotwoods](http://vvvv.org/users/elliotwoods)
  
  Mixed type support and GUI convenience sponsored by [m-box](http://www.m-box.de/).
  
  v1.2:
  * set nodes set pin changed from bang to toggle
  * insert nodes insert pin changed from bang to toggle
  (bang type was preventing alteration in subsequent frames)
  
  v1.1:
  * fixed wrong output slicecount on GetRow Dynamic
  * culture info is set to invariant culture
  * copy paste handles arbitrary decimal separator
