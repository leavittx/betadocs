I updated my old PhidgetRFID plugin to comply with PluginInterface2. 

Now it supports multiple Readers. As a bonus it has features to time-multiplex the antennas, so you can use the phidgets in close proximity without causing interferences in the electromagnetic fields. Also it behaves nicely with plug&play.

Helpfile included.
