  This plugin provides an implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm for VL, based on [viceroypenguin's C# lib](https://github.com/viceroypenguin/DBSCAN). It allows you to track clusters of points inside a 2D pointcloud. 
  
  It can be useful if you're using a LIDAR to track people in a room, or hands on a wall.
  
  To install, go to VL's command line and type
  
  ```
  nuget install VL.DBSCAN
  ```
  
  An example patch is provided with the package. Also, you can find the source of this plugin [here](https://github.com/sebescudie/VL.DBSCAN).
  
  Enjoy, and if something goes wrong please shout!
  
  **UPDATE :** The plugin now uses Xenko Maths, and its help patch is available in the help browser.
