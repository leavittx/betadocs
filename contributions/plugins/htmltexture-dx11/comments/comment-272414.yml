  Hey there, same here. HTMLTexture stays as a red node. Any updates? :(
  EDIT: Disabling the evaluate pin turns it grey again, but nothing to see in the renderer using the UI sample helppatch. TTY renderer also show's
  ```
  00:00:32 ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate
  00:00:32 ERR : Attempted to divide by zero.
  ``` 
  Using beta 38.1 with x64.
