  Most excellent!  A few questions:
  
  - Is it possible to change where the cache lives, so it is not in the plugin folder?
  
  - How does one do a global vs. object callback?
  
  - The "Show Devtools" pin is obvious enough (LOVE IT), but what about "LivePage" and "Console"?
  
  Thanks gumilastik!
