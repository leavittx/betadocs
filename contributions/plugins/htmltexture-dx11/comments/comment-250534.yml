  I tried replacing ChromiumFX.dll with the latest version, but the node turned red. 
  TTY gives this error: "Method not found: Void Chromium.CfxWindowInfo.SetAsWindowless(Boolean)".
  I tried updating the DLL because I was hoping to solve a problem with my HTML5 app that doesn't occur in the current versions of both Chrome and Chromium.
