  VL.IO.Net.Email is a VL set of nodes to do basic email tasks. 
  
  Included nodes are:
  
  * SendEmail
  * SendEmail (Spread) 
  * ListEmails
  
  The nodes can be used in gamma, beta and alpha.
  
  Both SendEmail nodes use the standard System.Net API and support only SMTP.
  
  ListEmails uses [MailKit and MimeKit](http://www.mimekit.net/) and currently supports only POP3.
  
  ListEmails assumes all attachments are image attachments and tries to parse their content as such.
  
  ListEmails supports embedded/inline image extraction.
