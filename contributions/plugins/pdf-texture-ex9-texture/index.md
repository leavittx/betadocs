Used libraries and tools: [PdfSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.com) and [muPDF](http://mupdf.com/) Please read their licensie agreements.

PDF files used for help-patch: [dont panic - the noobs guide to vvvv](xref:contribution/dont panic - the noobs guide to vvvv) by [roman_g](http://vvvv.org/users/roman_g) and [illustrated guide to vvvv for newbies in computer arts](xref:contribution/illustrated guide to vvvv for newbies in computer arts) by [bo27](http://vvvv.org/users/bo27)

Libraries have some functional limitations (e.g. can not use layers from pdf file). But it's still better than nothing.

for beta28.1
simply copy dll from beta28.1 to the dependencies folder,the static one seems not fully working atm?
