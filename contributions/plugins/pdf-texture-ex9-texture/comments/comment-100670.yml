  Hi guys,
  PDFTexture plugin works fine with b29.2x86. I copied dll files from vvvv folder to the dependencies plugin folder. 
  
  Now I have some suggestion:
  * Is it possible to update the plugin with the last PDFsharp and MuPDF libraries that support last PDF file version?
  * Would be great if the PDF conversion was done in an extra thread so that vvvv isn't blocked while the plugin loads all the PDF files. Something like <span class="node">Preloader (EX9.Texture)</span>.
  
  AAA looking for some vvvvoluntary! :)
