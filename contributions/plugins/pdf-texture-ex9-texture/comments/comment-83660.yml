  Hi,
  may I ask why the .csproj doesn't point directly to %vvvv%\lib\core\etc instead of pointing to ..\..\..\lib\core\etc ?
  I'm using 27.2 getting red PDFTexture node, though working fine.
  
  Thanks.
  
  
  EDIT:
  @circuitb
  I still get those cmd windows popping out. Would you suggest something more? XP32 here.
  * Sorry, works really fine. I had to do this into vvvv's editor.
