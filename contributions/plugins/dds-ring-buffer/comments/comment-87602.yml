  yes.
  certainly possible.
  it's not going to be very tidy for changing spread-count
  accidentally feeding in a large spread is going to either:
  a) be capped (i.e. hard cap on number of slices)
  b) crash (you'll allocate too much cpu and gpu ram)
  
  is this something immediately useful?
  i haven't got the source here anymore
