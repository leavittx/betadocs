  **MQTT** 
  short for Message Queue Telemetry Transport, is a light weight open Source messaging protocol for the Internet of Things.

  **Why should I use it?**
  MQTT is a great and **easy** way to exchange low frequency messages like sensor readings, or program states etc. between multiple machines and services. Its very robust with a small footprint. 
  It is based on the publish/subscribe paradigm and requires a central MQTT Broker.
  
  **Cool:** 
  * You can host the broker in the public web and communicate with nodes in local networks.
  * Which means you can communicate with your an Arduino anywhere on the planet which is connected to the internet: <https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient> 
  * The communication is asynchronous and won't block vvvv!
  
  If you wan't to host your own broker have a look at: 
  * Simple but powerful broker: <http://mosquitto.org/>
  * Full IoT stack including an MQTT broker for the Rasperry PI: <http://thethingbox.io/> 
  
  **Funfact:** 
  The Facebook Messenger is build on MQTT: <https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-facebook-messenger/10150259350998920>
