  This plugin is a generic string replacement sort-of thing. 
  
  StringReplacer.zip: Includes 3 dynamic plugins for doing string replacements. The most useful of these 3 plugins is StringReplacerSpreadable. These plugins are very useful for injecting information from your vvvv patch into your Fantastick JS code.
  
  For Example:
  
  Input:
  Hello, my name is $1, I am feeling very $2, how about you, $3, are you $2?
  
  Replacements:
  $1 = John, $2 = happy, $3 = Bill
  
  Output:
  Hello, my name is John, I am feeling very happy, how about you, Bill, are you happy?
