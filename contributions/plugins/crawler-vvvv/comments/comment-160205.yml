  @kalle
  just checked, first attempt via patching was in 2007, hehe
  
  @sanch
  that's the plan, though assets won't be collected. how could it know. modules, and shaders for sure, plugins will be tricky due to the dependencies
  
  @sanch&circuitb
  once i know that it definitely catches all the necessary infos i'll implement the collecting. that's why i need some testers...
