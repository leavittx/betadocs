  very similar to <span class="node"> Finder (VVVV)</span>
  
  for all the messy patchers to find the patches (and other externals) you actually used in a project. 
  
  the plugin crawls through your vvvv project and outputs nodes that are used outputting nodename, filename (if available), nodetype and occurrence (count and parent patch)
  
  please report your findings.
  more features still to come and very alphaish yet so i can't guarantee it doesn't break stuff
  
  happy crawling!
  woei
