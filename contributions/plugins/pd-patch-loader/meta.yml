  This is an example from the *Working with the vvvv-sdk* workshop at [node13](http://node13.vvvv.org).
  
  The example was chosen to demonstrate the steps necessary to include a thirdparty native dependency in a plugin, ie:
  * use ProjectExplorer (Ctrl+j) to add a reference to the managed wrapper of the native dependency
  * add the namespace to the *using* section of the plugin
  * copy the native dependency to the output directory (\bin) manually
  
  The plugin simply takes a .wav file and a .pd file. While the file is played back using the [NAudio](http://naudio.codeplex.com) the processing is routed through the given pd-patch via the [libpd](http://libpd.cc/) library which can even be sent values to from the vvvv-patch.
  
  Note: This example requires an ASIO driver for your sound card. In case you don't have one, get it from: http://www.asio4all.com
