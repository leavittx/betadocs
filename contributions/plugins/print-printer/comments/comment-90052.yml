  @h99: I assume that: 1) You know the name of the printer, or 2) you use the *Printer *node to find the default printer. Anyway, additional check is always good! Thanks for the feedback! I will put some validation and update the plugin. 
  
  edit: Now it checks, please, test. Thanks.
  edit 2: Also, is there some input setting for the *Print* node that you would need/add or that's sufficient?
