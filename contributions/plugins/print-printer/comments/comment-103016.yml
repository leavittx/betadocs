  Hi Sansui,
  
  thanks for the feedback! Without the actual device I have no chance to test it. My guess is to change the printer settings, like paper size, dpi and so on.
  
  EDIT: Just tested with 45beta30.2x86 and it prints on regular laser printer.
  The DXTexture -> AsString is set to BMP. What image format your device is supporting? What is the vendor/model of your device?
  
  regards
  Zeos
