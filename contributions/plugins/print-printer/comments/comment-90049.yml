  In the example, <span class="pin">Printer Name</span> receives infos from printer's <span class="pin">PrinterName</span>, which the most comfortable option: here default printer name is 7 word long, about 30 chars, and anyway is just one of the 7 installed printers, including one note, xps and so on; after reading your answer I tried to input a wrong printer name and vvvv crashed, so I set an IOBox up the <span class="pin">Select</span> of <span class="node">Select (String)</span> to choose a printer and feed print node with a correct name.
  Hope now is more clear what I was saying :) (or maybe I'm missing something simple!)
