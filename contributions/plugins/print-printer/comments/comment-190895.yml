  Another v4 mistery: this print-function is really cool and works (kind of) fine in my patches here. BUT: only when the patch containing the print is open and the patch window selected on top.
  Any ideas?
  
  Is there an alternative way to print directly from the renderer (without saving the image to disc)?
