My first exploration into plugins, so not optimised I imagine! 
The plan is to try and make particle system modules as per a thread [vvvv-particles-library](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vvvv-particles-library) on the forums a while ago, so to do are avoid enemies, follow leaders etc.
Hopefully they may help others trying to learn c# too! 
Feel free to chip in FX if you come up with any!
