  Hallo,
  I am experiencing a weird and difficult to debug behavior, touches become unvailable or just a single touch is available at some point, it can happen from time to time or at application startup, I haven t been able to find a pattern to reproduce this problem. 
  Anybody has experienced anyhting similar?
