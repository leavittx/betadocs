  is this related to this plugin ? 
  
  can you check two things:
  
  01. can you reproduce this with just the touch nodes in your patch
  
  02. does this happen with [windowstouch](xref:contribution/windowstouch) too ?
  
  we had problems with the touch nodes made by devs while the "old" windowstouch plugin always worked. if so, its probably worth starting a forum thread
