I was doing some search today about multitouch image galleries in vvvv, but all I could find was MINT (which seems dead since last NODE) and elliotwood's year-old (([multitouch-stack](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/multitouch-stack).)) After some dll-collecting and repairing some things, I found latter one is still quite useful as a simple multitouch solution, so here it is with some additions such as aspect ratio correction and automatic initial image layouting.

PS: If I just overlooked something and there is already a built-in/much simpler/more convenient way, please tell me... :)
