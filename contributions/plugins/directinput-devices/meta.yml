  simple stuff. outputs relative mouse data in mickies, and outputs all the buttons (including MB4 and MB5) also outputs direct data about keyboard.

  i've created this because <span class="node">Mouse (System Global)</span> and <span class="node">Keyboard (System Global)</span> was buggy for me in certain situations (they don't work in multiple instances of vvvv, and sometimes cycle mode is buggy)
  
  also i attached a <span class="node">Camera (Transform Softimage)</span> mod using this plugin for a better example.
  
  Read the help patch! it contains several warnings!
