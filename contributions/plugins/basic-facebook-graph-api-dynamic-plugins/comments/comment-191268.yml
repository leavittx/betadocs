  Just checked the versioning and availability at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog
  The plugins were written against the 1.0 version from 2010 and should "expire" in 10 days (30.04.2015), lol. What a timing. 
  You mind to tell what is broken already or errors?
  I still can not test it myself.
