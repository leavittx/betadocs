  when editing, you just upload a new file and in the description of the new file, you write what is new about this new file.
  
  I allowed myself to change the description to match what you wrote in the about part
  
  EDIT: and then of course not delete the old files
  
  EDIT2: Apparently I can't change your description, you need to do that
