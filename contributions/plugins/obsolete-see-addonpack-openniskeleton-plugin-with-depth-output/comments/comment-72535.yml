  the disparity value returned from the PrimeSense sensor (i.e. kinect) is 11bit, where the 11th bit is only used for very distant values
  
  when you convert this value into mm's, then you need 13 bits
  
  easiest way to get this into a shader is as an unsigned 16bit texture (then multiply back in shader by pow(2,15))
