  The depth map returned by OpenNI is actually a bitmap where each 16-bit pixel contains 13 bits of depth information as the distance in millimeters (roughly).
  </div>
  can you provide a resource (link) for that specification? i can only find info that says the depth sensors resolution is 11bit, [like here](http://mathnathan.com/2011/02/03/depthvsdistance/). probably the openni-api returns those 13bit but i cannot find information on that?!
  
  **edit:** and also what do you mean with (non-) AGC grayscale?
