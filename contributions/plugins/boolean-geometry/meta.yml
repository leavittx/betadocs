  ###  Boolean operations on groups of meshes 
  
  ###  Features:
  
  - Easily use boolean operations (union, intersect, minus, xor) on 2 or more meshes to create new objects
  - Define a complex (recursive) "tree" of operations using helper nodes, see image below
  - Resolve feature eliminates intersecting faces of 2 or more meshes by adding new triangles with shared edges along intersections in all input meshes, useful e.g. for [tetgen](xref:contribution/tetgen) inputs
  - including helpfile{s}
  
  
    
  
  This is a wrapper around boolean functions, i.e. CSG Tree, in libigl by the Interactive Geometry Lab @ ETH Zurich: http://libigl.github.io/libigl/
  
  
     
  
  ###  Source Code:
  
  - the source code for the vvvv plugin plus the c++ dll can be found in my addonpack fork:
