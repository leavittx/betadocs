  a couple of years late here comes the [ms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputmsg/wmpointer-reference) recommended way (since windows 8) for handling **mouse, touch and pen input** with proper **gesture handling** and **touch injection**.
  
  the touch and gesture APIs actually use this unified api windows internally anyways so performance should be at least on par.
  
  ##  benefits over the existing implementations
  
  * touch and gesture are not mutually exclusive anymore
  * gestures can be used with mouse or pen input as well
  * **unified interface** means no more building your own input object and switch between mouse and touch when developing.
  * touch **injection** lets you simulate multitouch systemwide. (beware, it will take over your cursor!)
  * fine grained control over gestures: specify type (translation, scale & rotation), allowed axis & inertia params
  * gesture takes care for you, whether it's a gesture or a (double)tap/click
