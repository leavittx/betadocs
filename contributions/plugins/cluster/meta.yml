  **v1.0 Changelog**
  
  based on dbscan, now it works far more robust against noise. changed category from value to 2d. some extras like lifecycle, motionvectors & automatic linear movement after losing tracking, affinity of the points (0=noise, 1=empty, then the clusters) and so on, try it and leave your messages, ideas & hints here or in the thread linked above.
