  ah well, 
  the helpfile is referencing to Chaos.v4p which is a [Subpatch](xref:b66f153a-f7c3-4867-a8c9-bce69861d759) of the Group (2d) module i dropped somewhere in the 2.0-tikiwiki-forums. 
  
  so everybody starting this helppatch with a "virgin"-b25 installation will have 2 red nodes called "Chaos"...
  unless this subpatch can be found in 
  ```
  "%VVVV%\modules\Group (2d)\Chaos.v4p"
  ```

  dear chmee, pls don't take the following as offense:
  dear devvvvs, pls DO take the following as offense:
  
  after having a closer look at *\*\*Cluster (Value) help.v4p\*\** 
  using the free [XMLmarker](http://symbolclick.com/the_tree_view.htm) (must-have!) i encountered a funny thing again:
  
  vvvv's xml makes use of (at least two) new attributes called ***systemname*** and ***filename***.
  again those new attributes are neither documented nor part of the <glossary>(https://vvvv.org/glossary) of vvvv
  
  have to complain about this in the bug section.
