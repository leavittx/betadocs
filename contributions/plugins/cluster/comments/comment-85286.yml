  I just noticed that in the help patch that the dots and the corresponding boxes usually do not have the same color, indicating mismatched IDs.
  
  And I also just saw a case where the ID list had a number twice (6, 1, 5, 6) - should that be possible?
  
  -edit-
  
  OK, so I'm guessing that in Members the IDs are +2 to make room for the affinity values 0 and 1, but the double 6 in the IDs still puzzles me.
