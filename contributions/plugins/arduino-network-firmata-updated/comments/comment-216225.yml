  =UPDATE 01.2016=
   Hello everybody, a little update, since i'm no longer using the files i've uploaded.
  This update contains the same patch i'm using to control an arduino mega, and the
   same custom_firmata i've uploaded on my mega. It is based on the new firmata update,
   version 2.8.0 which you can download here: 
  
  <https://github.com/firmata/ConfigurableFirmata/releases/tag/2.8.0>
  
   with the latest UIP protocol that you can find here: 
  
  <https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip/releases/tag/UIPEthernet_v1.59> 
  
  (you will need it if you use enc28j60, if not, it should work without it). The main difference, 
  is that this custom firmata is edited to auto-connect, and keep trying to connect if 
  it does not have a connection to your patch. It works better than the one prior to 
  this, as the prior would stop connecting if it would lose the connection(example: 
  patch quit, computer restart, power loss, cable unplug). This update, as tested by 
  me, will auto-connect no matter what happens to the connection. As before, be sure to 
  set your ips and read the comments for more configs. PS: this "ConfigurableFirmata" 
  was compiled and uploaded with IDE 1.6.7, and it should work fine with prior versions 
  of the IDE.
