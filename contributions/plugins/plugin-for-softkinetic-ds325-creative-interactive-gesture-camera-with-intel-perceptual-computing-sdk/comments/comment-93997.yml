  SUCCESS!  This plugin does require the first SDK beta, not beta2.  After some thrashing, I found it here:
  
  http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/2808/IntelPerceptualComputingSDK-Beta.zip
  
  Uninstall the previous PCSDK, remove the PCSDK folders, install this, and it seems to work with 29 with no further thrashing.
  
  Wheeeeee!
