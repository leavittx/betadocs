  Hi vvvvolks,
  
  I just installed the Intel Driver (beta1) 32bit from  metrowave's link,
  but when I run the examples I got that:
  
  <div class="box">
   c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\PCSDK\bin\win32>gesture_viewer.cs.exe
   Failed to locate a capture module
  </div>
  
  in vvvv I get exception
  
  Any ideas
  
  Thanks!
