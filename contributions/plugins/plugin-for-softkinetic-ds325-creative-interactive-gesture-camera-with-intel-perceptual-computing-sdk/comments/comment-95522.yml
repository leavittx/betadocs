  Thanks a lot herbst. great efforts, so this new update is for the latest IntelÂ® Perceptual Computing SDK 2013 Beta. Looking forward to testing it, have to upgrade the SDK first. I think I do have the voice recog/synthesis v.2 addon, it's 524MB. with Intel's permission I'm uploding it on 4shared and will post the link here, if you don't have it you can try that first.
  
  Edit: here is the Intel voice addon SDK:
