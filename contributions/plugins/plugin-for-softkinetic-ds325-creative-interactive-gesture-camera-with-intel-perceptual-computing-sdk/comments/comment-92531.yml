  Thanks for the plugin, got my camera today!
  
  But sadly, no workey: Win7 x64, SDK installed, samples work fine, 28.1.  No red node, but "DS325 (Devices DS325) help.v4p" never shows enabled or info, and console gives:
  
  00:00:01 ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate: Access violation at address 6F651B27 in module 'libpxcupipeline.DLL'. Read of address 6679B3F0
  
  Reinstalling, moving things, made no difference.
  
  Thanks again!
