  Ahhh, yes, that's why I listed I was using 5831 in my initial posts, I thought a PCSDK mismatch might be the problem.
  
  Unfortunately, Intel does not offer specific downloads that I can find, just the latest which is 5831, so no way for me to try an older one.  Can someone post 5057 here, purty please?  Or can anyone confirm things working with 5831?  Thanks folks!
