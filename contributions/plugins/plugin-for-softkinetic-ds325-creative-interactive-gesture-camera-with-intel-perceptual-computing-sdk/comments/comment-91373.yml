  @microdee: the difference is the close interaction, and its quite stable for hand/finger position and orientation. (Actually, depending on how good the Leap works, this might of course be kind of redundant).
  Oh, and you get head tracking with "landmark detection" (eye and mouth corners).
  
  I attached some images. What you see there is
  * infrared image (you get RGB, depth, noisy infrared and "label", which is a hand and head mask)
  * hand openness (between 0 and 1)
  * fingertip positions
  * hand position, palm normal, and pointing direction
  
  Works best in a standard desktop environment. Works, but not as good when camera isn't in front of you (e.g. above or somewhere else).
