  hello thank you for the update. 
  
  I tried all the help patches, 
  
  i got working the voice recognition. At first it was showing strange letters but later started to work quite good with lots of words and phrases.
  
  The face patch it,s the only one that got the camera to turn on the green light.
  In this one i saw some activity a square in the left corner of the renderer sort of responding from the face.
  
  The rest did not work. 
  
  I tested with last alpha 29.5
