  Thanks again herbst, everything works well for me using alpha29.3 except that the help patches work one at a time, meaning after closing one you have to quit vvvv before starting another one of DS325 help patches. 
  
  The voice recognition and the accelerometer effect are very good and interesting indeed. The face recognition also works. 
  
  @colorsound, just retry it but quit vvvv and restart between the patches, also the lights on DS325 is not always on the same way, but the unit works.
