  Thanks... if it is the one linked in this thread, that is the one i tried. i hope you do have a different one. i'm not sure what to do next.
  
  i found on the intel forums that some ppl had trouble in the past unless they disabled their onboard webcam (i guess it will show up as id 0 to opencv)... it didn't help me.. but i am posting that solution here in case it can help someone else.
