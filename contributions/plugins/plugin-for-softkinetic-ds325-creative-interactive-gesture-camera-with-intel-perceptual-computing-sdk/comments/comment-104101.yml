  Hello Guys,
  
  did you already manage it to use the face recognition in VVVV?
  I got the Sample in the SDK working, but i am not sure, how you could implement that feature in VVVV. Any Ideas on that? I want to save different Persons (give them different IDs) and want to recognize them later.
  
  Great if somebody could help or even send a testpatch ...
  
  Thanks in advance
