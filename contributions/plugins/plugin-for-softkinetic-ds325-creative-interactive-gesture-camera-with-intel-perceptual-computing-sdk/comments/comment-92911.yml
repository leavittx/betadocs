  Still no joy moving the DS325 folder.  I tried moving the SDK DLLs into the DS325 folder as well since they are in the same folders as the example .EXEs.
  
  I thought maybe this was a 32/64 bit issue, so I pulled out a laptop with Win7 x32, installed 28.1 and the x32 PCSDK, examples run fine, same behavior with the patches.
  
  The only difference I did notice when running vvvv.exe first is that it takes longer to fully initialize, as if it is initializing the hardware, but I still get the same fault.  When I run the patches directly, the camera can be unplugged and it acts the same (immediate fault).
  
  @herbst: I'd be happy to help debug this.  I've got an outrageous art project in mind this camera is perfect for, and I'd rather help get this working than make my own plugin.
  
  Thanks all!
