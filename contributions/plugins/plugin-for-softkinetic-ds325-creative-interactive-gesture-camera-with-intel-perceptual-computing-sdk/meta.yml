  Heyho,
  
  here's a pretty much complete plugin for Intel's "Intel Perceptual Computing SDK" ([here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/perceptual-computing-sdk)).
  
  It works with two cameras:
  Softkinetic DS325
  Creative Interactive Gesture Camera
  (the two are the same device in different housings...)
  
  You need to install the Intel PCSDK from above URL.
  
  Note: Currently, the Intel PCSDK (and thus this plugin) does not support 
  multiple cameras.
  
  2012-11-15: Initial release. Proudly presented by MESO.
  
  2013-01-30: Changed to beta 2.
  
  2013-05-07: Changed to release version of PCSDK. Added support for voice recognition.
