Comes with a wikipedia parser by [joreg](http://vvvv.org/users/joreg).
has several force models implemented:
- the classic Eades forces
- Fruchterman-Reingold forces
- Spring-Attractor, as found in the book 'Generative Gestaltung'

to install the plugin, just put the folder in the zip inside your /plugins directory in your external contributions folder. remember, you should never put custom content into the vvvv folder.
