  Hadasi,
  
  I had the same problem as you, and I seemed to have fixed it just now.
  
  Right click on all the .dll files that come with the pack, including the sanford ones, and click properties. You will notice a message that says:
  
  Security: This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer
  
  Just click the button next to the message that says "Unblock" and you are good to go. You have to do it for all the files in nodes/plugins and the sanford .dlls individually, but after that the nodes shouldn't be red.
  
  Jon
