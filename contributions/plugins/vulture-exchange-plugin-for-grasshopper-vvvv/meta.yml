  This plugin allows you to easily send geometry and other data from Grasshopper for McNeels Rhinoceros to vvvv in almost realtime. 
  
  * send Meshes
  * send Points
  * send Numbers (floats)
  * send Text (strings)
  * send Rhino Camera from ActiveViewport
  
  The data is stored and exchanged via an *.vltr file. So you can also use it via a network folder or send the file to somebody else.
