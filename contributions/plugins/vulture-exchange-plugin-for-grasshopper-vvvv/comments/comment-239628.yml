  I tried this, but keep getting an error in Grasshopper. I did the unblocking of the zip file.

  I am using the latest Version 0.9.0076.
  
  Also I would suggest using the File Path component and not adding the file extension in the vulture component. That way you can just right-click and "set one filepath" rather than typing in the file path without the file extension, which makes no sense.
  
  EDIT: Forgot to unblock the slimDX.dll file, dohh!
