inspect patches with ease, no more scrolling and selecting links...

select a node, press TAB and start navigating connected nodes with arrow keys.
(or WASD for the gamers or if you don't want the nodes to be moved)

the node navigated onto will be centered and selected -> used by inspector

no traversing into or out of subpatches (yet)

q: what would you need that for?
a: ever had to debug really messy patches? (not your own of course)
