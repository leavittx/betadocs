  inspect patches with ease, no more scrolling and selecting links...
  
  select a node, press TAB and start navigating connected nodes with arrow keys.
  (or WASD for the gamers or if you don't want the nodes to be moved)
  
  the node navigated onto will be centered and selected -> used by inspector
  
  no traversing into or out of subpatches (yet)
