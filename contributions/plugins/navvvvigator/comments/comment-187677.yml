  [woei](http://vvvv.org/users/woei), you seem the right candidate to help setting up a **diff-renderer** for .v4p files. I am thinking of just cloning the GUI-part of the vvvv source into a (standalone?) divvvv.exe, **painting deleted/moved/changed/unchanged/new nodes and links of two file versions in different colors**.  
  
  First Question would be: Are the necessary parts of the vvvv source accessible for such a project?
