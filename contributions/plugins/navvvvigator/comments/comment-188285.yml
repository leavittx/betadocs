  yes and no:
  * vvvv source doesn't give you access to drawing the gui
  * HDEHost gives you access to the current graph, so you could create a meaningful representation. don't know though, if you can use HDEHost as standalone, guess not.
  * xml files don't contain all the info to recreate the gui (e.g. pins with default values are missing, thus will mess up the visual appearance.
  * there's a xslt stylesheet to convert xml to svg.
  
  so the best shot would probably be a combination of all of those (which is quite some work and probably the reason nobody did it yet)
