  Indeed very nice!
  
  Kudos for finally introducing a basic <span class="node">Lerp (Value)</span> node. Don't know why noone else ever thought of simplifing a map this way, when it's safe to assume input is <0..1>. 
  
  On the same drift it would be awesome to further nodalize the Animator. The <span class="pin">repeat feature</span> could be a module that stops reporting change after when the first repetition kicks in. Pingpong is also a perfect candidate for being a module, inverting the signal every even repetition.
  Of what's left, it's very much like the good old <span class="node">LFO (Animation)</span>. <span class="pin">Seek</span> calls itself <span class="pin">Reset</span>; funnily, <span class="pin">Seek Time</span> is named <span class="pin">Period</span>, but imo it is more the offset time. Just silly name-calling ;)
  
  Anyhow, the <span class="node">Ease</span> plugins are a charm. They show great insight into stated-triggered motion on your part. It is a different paradigm then what vvvv is geared for, but it's always good to have proper and fast penner in our favorite toolkit, when eventually state becomes easy data.
  
  That said, please consider pullrequesting vvvv-sdk. Social Git can be a pain sometimes, but it would help a lot of people if your Lerps and Eases would join the pack, or even the [VVVV.Utils](https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/tree/develop/common/src/core/Utils/Animation).
