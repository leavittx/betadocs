  @tekcor @sinus @mediadog @anybody else having problems: if any of you can confirm that running the helppatch of [spoutcontrols](xref:contribution/spoutcontrols) and hit *write* will NOT create a folder *C:\ProgramData\Spout* and a txt file in it + you do get the same TTY error this could help a lot in tracking down what's wrong. Atm I believe that for some reason the path to the referenced dlls is not added (correctly) to your PATH environment variables....I'm working on finding a solution.
