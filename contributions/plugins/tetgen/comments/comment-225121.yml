  Not working for me, tried everything you listed above, no red nodes but console message that it can't find TetGen2vvvv.dll.  This is with 34.2_x64 on Win7 Enterprise x64.
  
  Hmmm, depends.exe shows the file 3dTetrahedralize.dll as an x86 DLL, and gives the error "Modules with different CPU types were found".
  
  So are you sure you've tried it and it works on x64?
