  hm, very strange. tested it today on 2 other devices without a problem....is TTY saying anything else?
  please confirm it doesn't work applying this order (which is what I do):
  -download plugin and unpack
  -start vvvv b34.2 x86 or x64
  -drag and drop 3dTetrahedralize.dll node in the patch
  -select the node and hit F1
  -a triangulated box should be visible now in the renderer
