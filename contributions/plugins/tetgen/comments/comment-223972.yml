  tbh I haven't tested it on another machine before and there has been some path issues, however, just tested the recent version on another machine and it's working fine, also with b34.2_64....so something else seems to be the problem here...anything else TTY is saying? 
  you can try copying the TetGen2vvv.dll in dependencies/x64 (as you're running 64 bit) to your vvvv directory, next to vvvv.exe, and also try next to 3dTetrahedralize.dll.....
  Please let me know if that's changing anything, unfortunately I'm not able to reproduce the error in order to provide more help.....anybody else got the same problems?
