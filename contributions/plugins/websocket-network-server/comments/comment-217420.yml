  But there is no c# project in the download.
  Just the DLLs. Would you mind to add the source?
  Or is it somewhere on your github projects already, sorry didnÂ´t find it.
  Would love to add SSL maybe. Thanks

  *(Package 'System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow,4.5.9' is not found in the following primary source(s): (....)*
