  oh yeah! i have a client implementation here if you're interested, using a little bit modified WebsocketSharp (added proper events for server events not just their behavior class)
  https://github.com/microdee/VVVV.Packs.VObject/tree/master/VVVV.Nodes.VObjects.Networking/VebSocket
  also there's the basic class for a server which populates all clients as separate objects meaning all clients can be treated separately. There are no nodes yet unfortunately.
  here are some help patches
