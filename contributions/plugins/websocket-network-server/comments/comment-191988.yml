  Yes, .NET 4.5 is there. It seems like it does in fact **only** work on my laptop (win7). Can't get it to run on any other machine, neither win7, win8 or win10.
  
  Even though it compiles fine on another Win10 system, it crashes during runtime.
  
  Any hints appreciated, as I'd really like to use this in the VVVV.js workshop at Node.
