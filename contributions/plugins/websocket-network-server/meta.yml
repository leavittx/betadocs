  A basic and generic Websocket Server node for talking with browser based applications.
  
  While initially created to communicate with its VVVV.js counterpart "Websocket (Network Client)" it can be used with any other application.
  
  Only supports the most basic use case. No subprotocols, SSL, etc.
