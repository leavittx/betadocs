  2021 and this is still a handy and nice Plugin for working with Astra and DX11.Particle but is the Texture spreadable? - I connect 2 Orbbecs and get 2Spreads of the Value Pins from the Nodes but only one Texture. - Do you have a solution? Is there an easy workaround? Or is this all outdated and there are other solutions?
