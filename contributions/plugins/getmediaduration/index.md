Gets the duration of multimedia files, implementing the [MediaInfo library](http://mediaarea.net).
Nothing too fancy, but I thought it might come in handy for others as well, since it covers a broad range of multimedia files.

Unfortunately it is not multithreaded, so vvvv might freeze a bit when being updated. You better update it during non-animated scenes ;)

*sorry, i forgot to add a dll to the package. Now its included. Hope it works now.
