better late than never! fall seems a good time to clean up and release old code. 
thus here come:

1.  ARDrone Nodes
a **nodeset as dynamic plugin** to control [parrot ardrones v2](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) in realtime.
wraps most fly-commands of the sdk in convenient grey boxes.

zip includes demo-files used for the [node13 copter workshop](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/lets-vvvvly-copters/)

<div class="box">
Note:
no warrant given here for crashing your drone
</div>

and in case you have any questions please note that i don't even have one of those toys
so external fixes and enhancements welcome here

sincerely yours
