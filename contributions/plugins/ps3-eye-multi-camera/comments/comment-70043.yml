  With Win7 x64 and beta26, things will run fine for anywhere from a few seconds to minutes, and then either the frame rate will drop to 1 every few seconds, or vvvv will crash (or both).  When the frame rate drops, vvvv is also very unresponsive, but my CPU use is down around 25%, the same as when it is running OK.
  
  Anyone else seen this?  Tried this under Win7 x64?  Thanks!
