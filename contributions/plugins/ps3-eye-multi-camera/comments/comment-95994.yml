  Hello.
  I have several PS Eye cameras, I try to connect them to one computer for record 640x480 75fps videos. I understand I can use only two for one computer. I have no progammers on VisualStudio. Can You help me - I need only capture from two PS Eye cameras, so let me download compilled programm for it? Is it possible?
  
  Thank You
