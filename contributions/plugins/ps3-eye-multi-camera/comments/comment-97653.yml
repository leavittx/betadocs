  Hi [NOD423](http://vvvv.org/users/NOD423), I tried this plugin.
  but node color is red, doesn't work.
  
  I think I followed your guide.
  
  http://codelaboratories.com/downloads/
  1. CL Eye Platform Driver install
  2. CL Eye Platform SDK install
  3. PS3EyeMulti-bin.zip download and run
  
  and.. 
  <div class="box">quote:NOD423:
  unzip PS3EyeMulti-bin.zip to vvvv/freeframe
  </div>
  what is freeframe?
  following [liquid](http://vvvv.org/users/liquid)'s comment, I copied "PS3EyeMulti.dll"   to "C:\vvvv_45beta29_x86\lib\thirdparty\freeframes".
  As freeframes folder doesn't exist, I created.
  
  but it doesn't work. yet.
  CL Eye Driver's CL-Eye Test is working.
  
  If you know my mistake, teach me please.
