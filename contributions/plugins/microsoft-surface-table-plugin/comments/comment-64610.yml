  Hi
  This I have already done. I put the SurfaceInput.dll in the vvvv/bin or in the plugins. When I open the helpfile there is only: Two Vector, Transform, Quad and Renderer Nodes. Should there not be a SurfaceInput. If I search for such a Node there isn't one in the list. 
  I use the vvvv40beta22, a version from this time of Surface 1.0 and which uses SlimDX9.
  Thanks for help!
