  Still not work with vvvv40beta22 or 23, SlimDX9 and Vista SP2 and the SurfaceSDK 1.0 on the MS-Surface1.0 :( The SurfaceSDK works fine.
  Do I have to run anything else with vvvv?
  
  I work in the Admin Mode of Surface, not in the User Mode.
  
  **Should there not be a SurfaceInput-Node??** If I search for such a Node there isn't one in the list!!
  
  Thanks for help!
