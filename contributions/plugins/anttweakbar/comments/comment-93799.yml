  Hoy smoke, missed this one, but this is a gamechanger for quick patching some GUI elements. 
  
  Thank you a million!!
  
  In full screen mode the keyboard shortcuts dont seem to work. (beta29). 
  It seems like the Alpha value of the color is add at the end of the process, it 'jumps on'. but since I use coloralpha=false for my lights, I don't mind.
  
  Minor Wishlist: 
  Use a texture (alpha enabled) as background.
  Add a parameter to hide the colormode picker.
  A way to scale the menu from within vvvv.
  When disabled we still see the help and shortcuts menu.
