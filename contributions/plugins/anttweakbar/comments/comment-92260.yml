  feel free to ask if you have any questions how to get your work into the addonpack and therefor automatically being built by our build server.
  
  the error people report here comes from an interface renaming. the non generic ISpread interface was moved to VVVV.PluginInterfaces.V2.NonGeneric.ISpread as it conflicted with the generic ISpread in c++ if i remember right.
