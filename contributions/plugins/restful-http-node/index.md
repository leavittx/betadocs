This Node allows easy access to RESTful Webapi's <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>

All basic HTTP methods as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are supported as well as basic HTTP authentication. The node should be quite flexible as you can path any string to the Body and define the Mime Type as required by the REST API you intend to interact with.

Find the code here: <https://github.com/JOxBERGER/VVVV-REST>

I wrote it as I had trouble using PUT methods with the existing HTTP nodes.
