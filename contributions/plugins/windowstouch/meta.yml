  Here we go, a plugin to receive touch (multitouch) information from windows7/8 touch compatible devices. 
  
  This plugin was tested with various hardware and OS versions:3M,Surface Pro, Dell Touchmonitor, PQLabs Frame, Windows7 and Windows8
  
  Nasty Windows Feature: Normally palmrejection is on by windows default, resulting in no touchdata on towndown. you can turn it off now.
  
  Initially after getting stuck developing this plugin i talked to master vux who got around the problem with a hook, getting control of the renderer. Microsoft didn't make it easy ;)
