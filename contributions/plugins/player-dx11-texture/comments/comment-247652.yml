  haven't used this one for a while
  
  @catweasel @velcrome
  the issues you two are referring to both stem from the module/patch where plugin is wrapped. didn't even know it was uploaded with a wrapping patch.
  so in case you work with fixed fps, use the vanilla plugin.
  
  the error cat is getting and also the one velcrome metioned is due to a negativ index in preloaded frames, which is somehow calculated in the patch.
