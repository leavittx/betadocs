  if your harddrive is too slow read the images, you won't be seeing anything with filetexture pooled either. in that case you won't run into a memoryleak with filetexture pooled. you will just have stuttering and probably black frames.
  
  if your harddrive matches the necessary bandwidth, there's no problem with player and last time i checked it was faster.
  
  producing an installation i'd assume one calculates the required performance of the hardware anyways
