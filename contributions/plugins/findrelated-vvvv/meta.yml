  once again a gimmick out of my vvvv workflow [trickkiste](https://dict.leo.org/englisch-deutsch/trickkiste)
  
  <div class="box">
  Note:
  ever had to find your way through somebody else's vvvv app, debug a **Send and Receive mayhem**, or refactor something really big? The project again **too big for the Finder** to handle?
  </div>
  
  then you will love this little helper
  
  1.  HowTo
  
  * selected nodes show up in the upper section of the GUI window
  * upon clicking one of those, related ones are displayed in the lower section
  * click on any of those and vvvv will set the focus on them (and open the parent patch if necessary)
  
  1.  What do i mean by related?
  
  * **Send** and **Receives** with the same identifier
  * **Joins** and **Splits** (within the same name and category, e.g. Vector 2D)
  * Join and Split (**Struct**) with the same declaration
  * **Message Formular** nodes with the same Configuration
  
  in case the node doesn't match any rule, it will return all instances of the same node
  
  and you can do some regexpr magic yourself to add additional matching rules
