  Hi tonfilm,
  let's say i want to have simple "Pause" at the end of Process 1
  ![](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/Procces%20OnEnd%20Action.JPG) 
  As workaround i can patch Process 2 as "pause" with Action Time -1, but maybe there is more elegant solution instead of patching every OnEnd action as separate process
