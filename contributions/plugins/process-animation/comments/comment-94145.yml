  having 'pause' states in between is good thinking. that is actually the idea of the -1 actions, to stop the process and continue whenever another condition is met. to start the next action then, you press 'Next'.
  
  the more elegant solution would be to have another bool input which defines whether the next action will start automatically... maybe i will find the time after node13 to code it.
