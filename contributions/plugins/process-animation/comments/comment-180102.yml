  A little something concerning what xd_nitro asked for.
  Seems like the Timings are system based (which is good, so it's tight), but I just had the issue that I had a little framedrop and the timings weren't in sync with what's on screen anymore.
  Will fix the framedrop anyway (some time), but it would be cool to have the possibility to make the timings dependend on the frames/mainloop to catch those drops.
