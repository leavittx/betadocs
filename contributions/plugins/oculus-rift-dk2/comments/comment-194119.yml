  I just build a render scene with the cones of where is the oculus on space
  another render to see on the main screen what we are doing with the oculus
  and i took microdee leep pack to get leapmotion inside oculus, and this is ffuuukjkkkdsfdsfjlnasfjn3lfj!!FMWEFA$!!!
  
  next step, to get the rigth data from leapmotion in coreletion with the oculus data so we can use hand skeleton in reletaion with the head position, i hope someone clever than me can help with the transformation side
