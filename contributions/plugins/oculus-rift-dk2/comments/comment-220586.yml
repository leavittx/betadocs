  Good Morning,
  I have a question regarding the Oculus patch I found on this link
  
  https://vvvv.org/contribution/oculus-rift-dk2-0
  
  It works perfectly.
  
  I have to create a Journey in my Oculus experience, so I need to move my camera in different positions in Space.
  
  In the patch the point of view of Oculus it seems Fixed, I can watch around in the 3d environment only from the same point of view and I 'm not able to move it.
  
  Could you please help me to find a solution?
  
  Thank you
  
  Tom
