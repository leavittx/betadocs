  I wrote this based off of the old plugin as I could never get that to work. I'll have a play around with a vanilla vvvv install to try and discover your problem. As for multiple gamepads, yes but 1 node per pad. I'll rewrite it in the near future to iterate over all with one node and use spreads as they were intended.
