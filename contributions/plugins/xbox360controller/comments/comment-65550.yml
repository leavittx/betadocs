  I can't get this to work, am I missing something? just Xbox360Controller.dll in the zip. it does not appear in the node browser when placed in the plugins folder.
  
  I can get the old xbox360 plugin to work: [xbox-controller-plugin-help-request](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/xbox-controller-plugin-help-request)
  
  One more thing, does this plugin aloow the use of more than one controller at a time?
