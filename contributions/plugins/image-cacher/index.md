Image cacher that loads a sequence of images into RAM.
Choose a file at the start of your sequence, and all the images in the sequence will be loaded into RAM (best watch your available RAM!)

Then you can select an index out of the sequence to be loaded as a texture.

Ideal for loading animation elements from Flash/other packages whilst avoiding the Flash Renderer and FileStream.

Maybe you've got other uses for it as well..

Big issue: not spreadable for now.
