  is there a config pin to change?
  I made a config pin on later versions to set a pre-allocated amount of memory.
  I was using 120frames in general (4s @ 30fps).
  I found that by pre-allocating the memory and keeping it the same throughout different sequence loads, then you avoid garbage collection.
  
  This plugin's now stuck on a machine in korea so cant look right now.
