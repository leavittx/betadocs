  haven't tried this, but probably it would offer the best results: https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/#detect-text here is an example of how to use azure cognitive services: https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/azure-speech-recognizer-demo/17251
  
  and i'm sure google offers a similar service if you don't wanna go for ms/azure..
  
  obviously those require a network connection and have additional costs.
