  This is really great!
  
  Few questions: 
  
  Regarding filesize and recording: 
  How long can you record a session without it being a problem to play without framefrops / loading issues?
  - simply because the filesize is pretty hefty. Would one minute or 2 up to 10 minutes be a lot? 
  - Would it work well without an internal SSD drive - internal hdd? - or USB3 SSD for example? 
  - Are there dropped frames? Ive been asked if this would work for audio Sync / Lip Sync. 
  
  asking because it seems like something i will end up using on a laptop :)
