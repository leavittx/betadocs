  Hello there, I am currently working with the *beta 40 x64*. Is there any way to get this plugin running since it is 8 years old? I have installed it multiple times, but the node/plugin does not recognize the runtime or the runtime language.
  Maybe there is a more recent plugin/node for realizing some complex text to speech. The *SpeechSynthesis* in the addons is too simple. I need more variety in voices and languages.
  Thanks in advance.
