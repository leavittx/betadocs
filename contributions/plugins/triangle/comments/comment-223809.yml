  I do understand exposing the neighbors can be useful, but I wonder when you will need the edges, isn't all the info in indexed vertices (+markers for boundary edges) already? Asking this because www.vvvv.org/contribution/tetgen also supports neighbors + edges- didn't need them yet, but it would be easy to expose there too....
  looking forward to your changes :)
