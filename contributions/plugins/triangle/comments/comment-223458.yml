  aha + oje....maybe we should have some system in place to prevent double developments? btw/fyi, i'm working on implementing this www.igl.ethz.ch/projects/bbw/; and as i need triangle (+tetgen) only as inputs for that i don't mind deleting this page/plugin if robotanton's plugin is more capable (eg this one does not support regions with differing meshing quality.....); or @robotanton feel free to hijack this page ;)
