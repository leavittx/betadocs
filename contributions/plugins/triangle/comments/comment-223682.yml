  @microdee: yes indeed, that's what boundary markers are for and I just realized yesterday that they actually are very useful, especially for geometry shaders.....didn't realize yet I'd need it for extrusion too as I remembered there's a way to test it, but obviously that's much better. 
  Will update asap to support boundary markers! As for the extrusion shader this has to wait a bit, but thanks for the input there, similar to what I had in mind, but again simpler, cheers.
