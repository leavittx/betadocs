  and unfortunately none of the contour nodes (neither freeframe and CV.Image) report if a contour is a hole or not :(
  
  for the extrusion mesh to work the triangle node have to indicate if a vertex is on the edge. if I remember well the Triangle library can tell you this information. after in geometry shader you can test which 2 vertices have this tag and create a quad between them for the extrusion wall. it can be solved with a module containing GeometryBuffer and InputElements advanced (for custom semantics)
