  if the other projects are GPL, then that means you have to release your source code also under GPL or stronger.
  
  But that doesn't mean you cant use it in your own commercial projects
  
  (correct me if i'm wrong)
  
  p.s. nice contribution!
  
  confirmed it doesn't work with 1.0.1 as you specified. downlaoding 1.1.5
