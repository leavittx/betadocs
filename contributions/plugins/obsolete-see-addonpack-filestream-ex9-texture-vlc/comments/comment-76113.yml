  That's really weird!!! I tried now to open Alpha 27.1 first. And then I opened your testfile with doubleclick on the file and I get always the same error. :(
  
  And the same happens, if I drag your testfile in the VVVV window or if I open the patch with the Open File dialog...
  
  I don't have copied the VLC in the plugins folder of VVVV.
  
  I'm using Windows 7 64 Bit italian version.
