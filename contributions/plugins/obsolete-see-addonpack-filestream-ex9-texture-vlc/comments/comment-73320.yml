  1) Install the latest VLC version on your machine (1.1.11)
  2) Download the vlc0_3test.zip (13.03.11) and the vlc0_3.zip (22.08.11) 
  3) Create a Vlc subfolder in your plugins directory of vvvv or if you are using vvvv45beta26 you can also create a Vlc subdirectory in your patchfolder project instead of putting it in VVVV.
  4) Extract there the vlc0_3test.zip and overwrite the Vlc0_3.dll with the vlc03.zip content
  5) Copy libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll in the same directory where you have the vlc0_3.dll file and the complete plugins folder from VLC in that directory
  
  Now it should work.
