  Hello,
  
  I have some questions for you guys... I don't understand at all the need for the plugin... sorry for my very basic questions :)
  
  which file formats are you using that vvvv can't open by itself? which are the things we can do with VLC?
  
  Im interested in the plugin coz I'm trying to get streaming video from and into vvvv (encoded with h264 if possible). I would be very happy to go as far as possible in that direction and share my experience. 
  
  The question is easy, did anybody try anything in this direction already? do you think this will be possible at all with this plugin?
  Any tips will be very appreciated!!
  
  Thanks a lot and thanks for the plugin!
