  mmm...the most basic question...I tried to install the plug-in but I couldn't...I followed the instructions in the ft's (21/03/2011 - 12:00) post.
  
  I hav the Vlc0.3test folder and inside its plugins/vlc folder I copied the .dll and the plugins folder from the vlcplayer...ft said that it wasn't necessry to copy the vlc0.3test folder inside anywhere, I have it on my desktop, but I can't find the "vlc=" inside vvvv.
  
  I know it is too basic but I didn't find the answer in another place. 
  
  Thanks 
  
  MJ
