  Hello, really nice plugin. I try to play a video on 4 HD projectors. As i want to use as much res as possible I tried the plugin with different videos in resolutions between 2000*225 to 7200*810. At some point i get an "Out of Memory exeption"
  CreateTexture(Slice 0, Device 60270176)
  ERR <A0+> <CreateDoubleTexture%20Exception> E_OUTOFMEMORY: Ran out of memory (-2147024882).
  
  I understand that it is a lot of data the plugin has to handle, but VLC player is playing the same files really smooth and without problems. I`m just wondering if there is something i can do about it. Otherwise I will have to use filestream an spanmode, which i would like to avoid.
  
  I`m using SSD and 8gb RAM Eyefinity 5870 with 6 Outputs
  
  
  BIG THANKS for the good work
