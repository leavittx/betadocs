  i'ld like to use vlc as a wav player and route the audio  streams to ableton live using virtual audio cable 
  
  the vlc plugin  seems to use the default audio driver defined in windows config panel and the aout command doesn't override this setting
  
  
  for that i need to select one of the  2  virtual ports
  with something like this:
  
  Audio1.wav | aout="directx" | directx-audio-device-name="Line 1 (Virtual Audio Cable)"
  Audio2.wav | aout="directx" | directx-audio-device-name="Line 2 (Virtual Audio Cable)"
  
  when i try the command line directly in vlc it works (eg: overriding the device selected in preferences)
