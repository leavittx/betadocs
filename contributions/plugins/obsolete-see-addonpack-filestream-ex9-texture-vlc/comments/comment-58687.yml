  Thanks for testing, glad you like it.
  
  Could you verify that the same files play correctly using VLC player? If not, it's a VLC issue. It's probably a (Lib)VLC issue anyway because I don't do anything different for big files.
  
  Does TTY renderer report any error when you try to open these big files?
