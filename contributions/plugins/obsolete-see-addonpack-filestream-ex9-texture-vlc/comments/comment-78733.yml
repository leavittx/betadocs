  How stable vlc-plugin is? 
  I'm building an installation with 4 screens and at least two layers of video. So far the plugin has been the best solution, much better than filestream/videotexture or making animation from single images (my videos are short 2-3 sec clips).
  Because the installation will be running several hours daily for a month, I'd like to hear others experiences. I'm using the latest version of both vvvv and vlc plugin and the computer will be running on win 7.
