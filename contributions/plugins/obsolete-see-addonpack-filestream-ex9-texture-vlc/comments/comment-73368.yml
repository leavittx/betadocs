  Don't mess in your VVVV directory
  
  The plugin should work out of the box:
   * extract everything to a new subdirectory in My Documents or where ever your keep your vvvv projects
   * (overwrite the dll with the most recent download)
   * copy libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll AND the whole 'plugins' folder (NOT THE INDIVIDUAL FILES, THE FOLDER) from your VLC installation folder **to the same folder where you can find the Vlc0_3.dll**. This should be **plugins\Vlc**. This means you would have some dlls in there AND ANOTHER FOLDER CALLED "PLUGINS" (the folder you copied from VLC).
