  While this is now in the addonpack for b29, I have not found correct instructions anywhere for the location of the libvlc_searchpath.txt file.
  
  If in b29 your "FileStream (EX9.Texture VLC)" node comes up red and you have VLC installed, you probably need to add the VLC path to:
  
  (vvvv root folder)\addonpack\lib\nodes\plugins\libvlc_searchpath.txt
  
  This should be added to the b29 installation instructions or at least the release notes.  Thanks!
