  hi i have been doing some more test with vlc plug is really a great treasure . 
  
  using win7 64 
  
  
  here some wishing points and bug i found : 
  
  wish Enable pin 
  
  bug sometimes you quit vvvv and it closes but vvvv process keeps on and imposible to kill therefore you can not open vvvv again until you restart 
  
  other times it closes the process eventually .
   
  
  Play button sometimes do not work and file keeps playing .
   
  
  btw i could use pointgrey firewire cameras via the plug too .
  i,ll keep reporting 
  
  thanks a lot for the plug .
