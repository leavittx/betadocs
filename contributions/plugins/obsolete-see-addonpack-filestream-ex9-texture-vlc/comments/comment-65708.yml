  Hello ft!
  
  I saw when I have two renderers with VLC, one on monitor 1 and the other in fullscreen on monitor 2 the framerate goes down drastically (from about 30fps to 8-11fps). When I return to windowed mode, the framerate goes back to 30fps.
  
  Did this happen to other persons or did I something wrong?
  
  
  Greetings from Italy :)
