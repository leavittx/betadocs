  Hi! What's means
  "From version 0.5 on, you need LibVLC 1.2"
  it is VLC 1.2? If so, where I can download it? On www.videolan.org the last version is 1.1.11
  
  Actually I have the 1.1.11, and I'm using the vvvv_45beta27. The VLC(EX9.texture 0.3) works great (lots of crash when I try to spread it, BTW) but VLC(EX9.texture 0.5) doesn't play any video!
