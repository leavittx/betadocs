  probably you already know about it just for the record: in alpha28 /dx9ex mode when the texture is created this is displayed in the log:
  ```
  00:02:05     : 
  CreateTexture(Slice 0, Device 60680992)
  <MemoryToTextureRenderer%20A0+> CreateDoubleTexture( device 60680992, 1024x768 ) called 
  ERR <MemoryToTextureRenderer%20A0+> <CreateDoubleTexture%20Exception> D3DERR_INVALIDCALL: Invalid call (-2005530516)
  ERR <MemoryToTextureRenderer%20A0+> CreateTexture(60680992 FAILED
  <MemoryToTextureRenderer%20B0-> CreateDoubleTexture( device 60680992, 2x2 ) called

  ```
  and (as tty says) no texture is created. when there's no /dx9ex it works fine
