  THIS PLUGIN WON'T WORK UNTIL YOU COPY SOME FILES !!!
  In order for it to work, you need to copy some files

  if the quality is there, as mainly its showing up, it would be really nice that a kind of installer cames along with main new plug ins systems, especially when there is some installation hardwork to do.
  
  i m thinking of: 
   - openCV enuGm from elliot
   - vlc plugin
   - kinnect plug in
  
  who are relaying on dll in certain places and third party installatio, and where it will not work if you dont have the good version of 3rd party installer.
  
  somehow an installer per main version would be great. 
  
  For myself, i have too much done reinstalls on computers, so i would like really those main contribs come with an installer. while touring, or while having someone on the phone stuck with a computer far away, it would be really greater to say: just install this and this. a kind of security.
  
  i know circuitb works with INO setup and got some experience of it ?
