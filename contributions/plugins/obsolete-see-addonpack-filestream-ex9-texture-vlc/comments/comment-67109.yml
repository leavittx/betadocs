  I'm still frustrated why patches with VLC node in it crash upon opening sometimes, but I don't know why that happens. In my experience, they don't crash if you open vvvv first, then open the patch, instead of double clicking the patch when vvvv is not running.
  
  When I was writing the plugin, I tested it with VLC versions that were current at that time, like 1.1.5, 1.1.6, 1.1.7. I don't see why 1.8 should give you trouble. Besides, VLC is already at 1.1.11 now. (but it will probably not work with versions >= 1.2)
