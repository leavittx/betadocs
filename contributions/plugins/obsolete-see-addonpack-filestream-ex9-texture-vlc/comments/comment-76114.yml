  I saw in the vlc0.5test beta27.v4p
  
  there is a reference to a csproj file in plugins\0.5EX9.TextureVlc\0.5EX9.TextureVlc.csproj
  
  which it isn't in the vlc05testbeta27.zip. Could it be that when you try it in alpha27.1 it opens your csproj file instead of the dll?
  
  The only way I get it to work in beta27 is when I move the vlc0_5.dll, the libvlc.dll and the libvlccore.dll in the same directory of the v4p file and not in the plugins/vlc folder.
  And in alpha27.1 gives me the error above.
