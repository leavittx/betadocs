  Hello ft!
  
  First, I want to thank you very, very much for this useful plugin. Finally somebody was so genius to create a node which lets you playback video on more than one screen. It runs very fast. Thank you for sharing it. :)
  
  I have seen an issue which probably you are aware. If I change patches containing the VLC node with the createnode pin, sometimes the file doesn't play and afterwards no other patch containing a VLC node works and vvvv crashes then very easily. (I saw more or less after the 20th patch change)
  My video loops are not very huge. The average size is about 100MByte.
  
  Do you or someone know a workaround to avoid this? I've tried to delay the string input of the filename, the play and loop value, but the problem remained...
