  Do you mean: 
  * the framerate is ok, when 2 renderers are on different screens but windowed, and it drops when you make 1 renderer fullscreen
  * or do you mean the framerate drops when you have 2 renderers on 2 different screens (as opposed to 2 renderers on 1 screen), also when both are windowed?
  
  It is normal that the framerate will go down, if you have 2 renderers on different screens, because (as long as vvvv uses DX9) the texture needs to be copied to the graphics card twice, one for each 'device' (screen).
