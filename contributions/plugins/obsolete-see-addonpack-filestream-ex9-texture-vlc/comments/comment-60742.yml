  Hallo ft!
  
  Great plugin, and excellent performance! Thanks a lot!
  I would love to use it in an installation but can't get it to work in fullscreen mode. Whenever I switch to fs=1, the screen gets grey and nothing happens anymore. (also tested with your help patch)
  
  on the tty renderer I get:
  
  ```
  CreateTexture(Slice 0, Device 84169760)
  ERR <A0+> <CreateDoubleTexture%20Exception> D3DERR_INVALIDCALL: Invalid call (-2005530516)
  00:01:21  *  : Cannot reset device. Try different parameters!
  00:01:21     : 
  
  ...
  ```
  
  Is there anything I could do about it or has anyone else experienced this?
  thanks a lot!
