  uff it crash in my computer (vista 64bit) 
  I have Vlc 1.1.7
  just to be sure I did everything right:
  
  -Copied the content of Vlc0.3test\plugins\Vlc inside the vvvv_45beta25.1\plugins directory
  
  -also the full VideoLAN\VLC\plugins directory, the libvlc.dll & libvlccore.dll file IN the same directory (vvvv_45beta25.1\plugins directory)
  
  when I try to open the vlc0.3test.v4p it crash immediately. If I try to creata a VLC node inside a patch, vvvv crash too
  
  
  :(
