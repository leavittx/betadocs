  I got a simple sevrver which streams from a webcam using mjpeg. I can get stream from web browser at http://192.168.1.126:86/broadcamjpg.html?src=1&speed=1 and http://192.168.1.126:86/broadcam.jpg?src=1&speed=1. But if I try to use this URL in VLC plugin I'm getting this error:
  
  <LoadImage%20Exception> URI formats are not supported.
  
  Is there a way to stream video from such a source?
