  @gaz: I haven't checked out the latest alpha builds, but if you want it to work, you should at least have a 64-bit version of VLC player installed (experimental build can be found on VLC website), and point to its location in libvlc_searchpath.txt
  
  @dEP: that file should exist already, if you created I guess you're not looking in the right place
