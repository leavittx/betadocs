  Hello, I'm trying to pipet webcam, but vvvv crashes|freezes; playing in VLC everything seems fine (just playing webcam, didn't tried anything else)
  
  vlc 2.0.4
  beta28.1/29
  xp 32 bit
  
  I would provide more info, but really don't know how, or what. If any test should be done, please ask.
  
  Thank you.
