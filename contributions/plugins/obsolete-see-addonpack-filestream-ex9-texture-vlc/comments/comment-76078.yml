  'writerange failed' sounds a bit like a 'not enough memory' problem.
  
  I don't know why it doesn't work for you guys in alpha27.1 though, it works over here.
  Just out of curiosity for the alpha27.1 version, could you check what happens if you open up vvvv first, and then drag a patch onto vvvv, instead of opening a patch by double-clicking in explorer?
