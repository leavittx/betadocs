  Odd, haven't seen a deadlock myself. But I did some code refactoring to have better separation between decoding and copying to texture, in order to reduce the probability for creating deadlocks... It's not impossible that I messed up somewhere :).
  
  Did you have the deadlock also with the example, or only with your own (probably higher res) video files?
  
  You shouldn't need the LibVlcWrapper etc. dll's anymore. It works over here without them. I will check but that's strange...
