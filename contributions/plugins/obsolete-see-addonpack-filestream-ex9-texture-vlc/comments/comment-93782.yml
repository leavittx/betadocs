  in order to avoid confusion i'd like to close/hide this contribution since [ft](http://vvvv.org/users/ft) put the plugin into the addonpack. so the latest working version will always be in the addonpack from now on and all stuff on here is legacy.
  
  would be nice though if ft or anyone familiar with the matter could improve the helppatch a bit. it should include all essential information that is available on this page and describe a few things in words which i have the feeling the current helppatch is missing. anyone?
