  @screamer: this one's not mine, i'm not using vlc for my decoder and it's not released yet :).
  
  @ft: works pretty well here, for a few problems on file switch (had one when i have 2 videos with the same file name as a spread for example). Saw you made the spread part working. Good work :)
  
  @ft + @sugokugenki : well spoke with elliot a bit about licensing.
  
  For the simple part, your plugin must be licensed under GPL, as you use GPL code. That obviously also means that anything done using your plugin must also be GPL.
  
  The second part bit of a pain, you can skype (jvulliet), or if you want I'll post it here. 
  
  Nice contrib!
