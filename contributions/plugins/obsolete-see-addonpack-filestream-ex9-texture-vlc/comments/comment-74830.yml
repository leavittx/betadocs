  Right. Can't get this to work in beta27. node appears in patch but is missing the video texture out pin.
  
  Have attached a pic of the text patch + tty and my plugins folder.
  
  in the plugins/vlc folder i've got vlc0_3.dll, libvlc.dll, libvlccore.dll, and the plugins folder from vlc directory
  
  where do those other files go? eg declarations.dll, implementation.dll etc
  
  this used to work fine in older vvvvs when you could just chuck in the install folder. But no more... 
  
  thanks for any help...
