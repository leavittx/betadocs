  You can play Youtube Clips in your vvvv patch by using this plugin.
  Just copy the youtubelink like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaKehq6qsdY
  open VLC Player, Media > open Location from Clipboard > Play
  Then  Tools > Media Information > Copy the Link from Location and open it with VLC Plugin from vvvv
  
  Perhaps somebody knows a way to get the "location "without this step?
