  Hi
  I am having this very same issue, the plugin works ok when it is in stand alone mode, straight into a quad and rendered but I get all kind of glitches and problems if it is routed into a shader, you can try it yourself using for example the Multiscreen module.
  The patch is completely stuck for a long time, and sometime the whole vvvv crashes, especially if the video files are too big.
  Any work around? Like loading a dummy video first or something?
