  could not open codec on x64, x86 works ok
  can you maybe specify version of ffmpeg to use?
  could there be same problem with PATH?
  
  wow found the problem, it did not liked resolution of 300x505, could we get some specification what can we do? can i somehow change the settings of codec etc?
  
  i can do whatever i want after recording with shellexecute and ffmpeg, but it would be nice to have some control over entry parameters if it is possible
