  Ha, indeed: **The 64bit version is hidden as "older version"** right here on this page.
  Now that i found it, it's working as a charm!
  
  ####  ~~Three~~*Two and a half* reason why i prefer this node over third party solutions:
  
  1. <span class="node">Texture AVI Writer (DX11)</span> records alpha channel (Admittedly the currently chosen FFMPEG CoDec doesn't, but [gumilastik](http://vvvv.org/users/gumilastik) could empower us to change this in the future)
  1. Any parameters in my vvvv patch can be added to the *filename.avi* automatically :)
  1. Recording of animations can be started and ended with frame precision, making production of rhythmic clips easy.
  
  Thank you for your quick support once again, [joreg](http://vvvv.org/users/joreg)!
