  <div class="box">quote:wikipedia:
  Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can optionally be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing messages in online discussion forums, or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents.
