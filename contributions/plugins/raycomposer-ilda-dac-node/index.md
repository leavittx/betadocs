With this node you can use RayComposer Laser Show DAC devices in your vvvv patch.
See <http://www.raycomposer.de/en/ilda-dac-interfaces/raycomposer-usb/> for more information.

RayComposer USB Device Features: ILDA Standard Projector Interface; 16 Bit position & 12 Bit color resolution; 6 color channels; sampling rate from 1 - 200000Hz; USB High Speed 480MBps; integrated DMX output and DMX input interfaces.

On modern Windows OS the devices work out of the box without further driver installation. (For older OS down to Win XP a driver is available.)

See the included help Patch "RayComposer (Devices) help.v4p" for usage hints.

The node should work on both x86 and x64 versions of v4.
