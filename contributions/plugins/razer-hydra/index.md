Yet another device which has a nice Unity3D API ported to vvvv.
May work with up to two devices and thus four controllers, but I weren't able to test that.

"The Razer Hydra consists of two controllers and a base station. It uses a weak magnetic field to detect the absolute position and orientation of the controllers with a precision, as stated by its developers, of 1 mm and 1Â°; it has six degrees of freedom."
