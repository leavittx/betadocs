  Hi vvvvs,
  I'm allready working on a plugin for 3d Flocking behavior, based on Craig Rainolds contribution.
  
  -> http://vimeo.com/25348020
  
  This beta version allready works with Flocking (3 Rules of Flocking and a Target Modus) and Predators. I also want to implement multible Flocks, Landing and some 3d spartial Grid sorting (...because of peromance like dottore said). I think i will contribute it soon. 
  
  When the 3d version is working, it should be easy to downgrade to 2d.
