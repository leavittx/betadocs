  Hi VVVVolks!
  
  I'm trying to integrate Hands and Gesture recognition to this plug-in. (Or just create another plug-in that can handle this)
  
  I started with Sample-PointViewer.exe in the NITE\samples folder, but is written in cpp and it's hard for me to translate it to VVVV cs.
  
  Googling on the OpeniNi Group I found this thread:
  
  <http://groups.google.com/group/openni-dev/browse_thread/thread/9ce6c8a2e27ff22f%20>
  
  You can download the lastest version of this cs application from here:
  
  <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1966569/kinect/kinect.rar>
  
  It's the 5th day I'm struggling with the code to understand what to put where, trying to translate it to match the VVVV OpenNiSkeleton Node structure, but no luck.
  
  If anyone can help me, thanks
  
  I started a forum thread about this where you can download the current status (error full) of the plug-in
