  looks really fun!  
  
  just got it running on XP, and had the same issues as catweasel before it would work, to sum it again in case it helps someone:
  
  open the /data/modules.xml file that comes with the plugin and fix program files paths to XP style
  
  Make sure it is in VVVV's plugin folder and NOT the addon dir or a custom addon dir.
