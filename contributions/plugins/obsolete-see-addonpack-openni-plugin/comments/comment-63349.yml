  Hey all
  
  sorry for not checking back here.
  to make my cs code work you'll need to add references to your node using the VVVV project manager (dynamic plugins) or in Visual Studio.
  
  I can't find the VVVV project manager myself right now (cant remember the keys, it's not listed in middle click menu, and not listed here either: [User Interface](xref:f63e83e8-88d2-4eeb-818f-5bfed4060a77) ). i'm sure i'll find out somewhere.
  
  I mostly listed the code to help out devs working on plugins, rather than expecting it to work 'off the bat'. code was moved to here:
  https://kimchiandchips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vvvv%20plugins/VVVV.Nodes.OpenNI
  
  It's not credited on this plugin so not sure if it made it in. Am going to try now to see if this'll work for my project.
  
  Elliot
