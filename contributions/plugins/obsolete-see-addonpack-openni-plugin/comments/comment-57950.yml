  the pipet will pipet a World XYZ position at a camera XY position.
  So you feed in a Vector2D in camera space, and it'll return a Vector3D in world space.
  
  Currently, you have to render the whole XYZ data for it to work (i.e. call the RenderXYZ() function, which isn't called if the WorldXYZ texture pin isn't connected)
