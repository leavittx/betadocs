  Update - skeleton is actually working well.  It's just hand gestures that are erratic.
  
  
  The bigger problem though is the Asus Xtion error.  The drivers I am using are-  
  
  - openni-win32-1.3.3.6-redist
  - nite-win32-1.4.2.4-redist
  - sensor xtion-win32-5.0.4.3-redist
  
  and I also have SensorKinect-Win-OpenSource32-5.0.3.4 installed to use with the Kinect.
  
  These are running in beta26 on Windows 7 64bit.  I'm using the 32bit drivers as the 64bit ones didn't seem to work for me.
  
  
  Cheers
