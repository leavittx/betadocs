  I tried too.. but no success..
  Suggested by Elias I installed SharpDevelop and link it to vvvv.exe application.. 
  
  <http://vvvv.org/forum/opennihands-trying-to-manage-hands-and-gesture-event>
  
  no success again.. too many things I've to understand first.
  
  Now I'm beginnnig from the basic c# programming.. the way is soo long..
  
  Every day I check the forum if someone create the "famous" global kinect node..(hand-tracking, advanced gesture recognition, custom calibration pose, tracking without posing) but seems that kinect isn't interesting anymore...
  
  I'll continue on my way.. If someone is interested in kinect or want to share his knowledge... 
  
  Cheers
