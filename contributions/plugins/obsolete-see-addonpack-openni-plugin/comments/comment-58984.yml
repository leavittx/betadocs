  ok working fine now
  
  uninstalled everything, ran regcleaner, reinstalled vvvv_25, ran -INSTALL- in vvvv folder, installed WinFormsViewer from http://vvvv.org/forum/45b25-not-really-working-here to get rid of EAccess violation error message 
  
  then installed
  
  NITE 1.3.0.18, OpenNI 1.0.0.25, SensorKinect 5.0.0, OpenNISkeleton_3
