  Hi guys,
  I tried the new Kinect_OpenNI_Library_1.3 but it doesn't work beacuse all nodes are red. I downloaded and installed the newest drivers listed. 
  
  If I downgrade to the Kinect_OpenNI_Library_1.2 with its appropriate drivers the plugin works fine.
  
  Has anyone tried the latest release?
