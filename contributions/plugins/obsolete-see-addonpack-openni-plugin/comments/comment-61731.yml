  Hey guis i just bough my kinect yesterday and im tring to figure it out how to make it work with vvvv
  
  i have seven 64b , n250 and vvvv 25
  i already install OPENNI-Win32-1.0.0.24-Unstable.exe
  windows didnt found the drivers, i was able to make it work after installing CL-NUI-Platform-1.0.0.1210.exe , 
  CLNUIDeviceTest works, but on vvvv with all the nodes that i tested i got
   a red node after the kinect node ... what is missing here ?
  can you guys leave a step by step order for the drivers ?
  i can restore the system with acronis to erase eveything and start from scratch
  
  ( i also tested leaving the .dll on the vvvv plugin folders, still the same )
  
  i thing that the issue is not vvvv, its the OnpenNI drivers, if i try to open the sample OpenNi / samples / open ni viewer i got this message
  
  "One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:
  Press any key to continue . . ."
  
  any help/documentacion to start with will be apreciated! :)
