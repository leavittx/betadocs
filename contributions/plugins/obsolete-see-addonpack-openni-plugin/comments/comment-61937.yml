  Mask texture is intended to cut within a range user pixel mask.
  About the pipet, open vvvv, double click and select pipet, then select node and press F1, the helppatch show you how to read pixels info using a texture, connecting openNi depth texture to it, you will be able to know the Z value.
  Starting from that you have info to transform stuff, hope it helps :)
