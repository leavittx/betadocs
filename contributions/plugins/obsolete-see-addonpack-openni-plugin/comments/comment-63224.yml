  @robe, thx a bunch.
  
  Though I did not get a lot of the instructions,
  I extracted the skeleton.zip into the plugins, and
  I unzipped the generic.zip into the skeleton folder (now within plugins).
  (was this right? ;)
  
  When I run the debug.v4p I get this:
  EDIT: Image removed due to excessiveness.
  
  I might have just misunderstood everything, and am supposed to make the skeleton myself?
  
  Edit: Really I might just need a help file :)
  
  Edit: Okay, I found the help file root_enjoy.. but all I get is a black screen.
  I installed everything in the order robe put up, what could the problem be?
  (I'm using vvvv 25)
  
  Edit: I changed the samplesconfig.xml to what Sapo wrote earlier in the post, and I finally get to see myself in the debug.v4p, though the help file still shows a black screen for a bout a minute or two, before it crashes.
