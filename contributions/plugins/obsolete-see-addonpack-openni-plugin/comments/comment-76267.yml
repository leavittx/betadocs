  @justnice about time to move on, as I recall, beta24 has lots and lots of strange bugs.
  
  If you are not in a hurry, you can wait for beta27.1 which is coming soon, then it seems both OpenNI and the kinect plugin are in the addon pack. and should then work if you just install the drivers.
  
  if you are in a bit more hurry, you could try the alpha version of the next beta.
  
  those would be my suggestions.
