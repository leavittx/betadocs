  Just figured out that the Kinect is listed under CL Devices in the Device Manager... maybe that´s because i´ve tested the kinect plugin written by vux (-> [kinect)](xref:contribution/kinect)) and now the driver is messing up the detection of the kinect with the OpenNI Plugin...
  Which would be strange since i´ve deleted every single folder and even ran ccleaner...
