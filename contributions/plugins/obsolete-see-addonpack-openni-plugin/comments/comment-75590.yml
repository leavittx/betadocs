  hi and thanx for this wonderful add...
  
  I seem to have some problems....I just got kinect and I so much wanna use it!!
  
  I used CL NUI to check if kinect works fine on my laptop running with Windows7 and it does!!
  
  I downloaded the latest version Kinect_OpenNI_Library_1.3 as well as the software and hardware pacs that are mentioned....
  
  After installing the pacs I tried to use the patches but no luck...I was getting a red node (missing kinect.dll)
  
  I downloaded earlier version and I found this dll I added but still getting this red node....Dnt know what to do....
  
  Do I have to copy some dll's from the pacs that I installed?
  What are the steps to make it work?...please any help!!!
  
  Thanx in advance...
