  hey elektormeier,
  
  the joints are also listed in the enum of the openniwraper i just passed them trough to the nodes. but they are not implemented in the Nite Algorithm. For further information have a look at the openni documentation. How openni and nite works together can you find here:
  http://www.openni.org/Documentation.aspx on page 5.
  
  @dl-100
  ckeck the config.xml in there you define nodes (they are also called nodes) for the openni driver.
  if there something went wrong or the nodes are not defined the right way the vvvv gets problem to create the vvvv nodes. 
  see: http://www.openni.org/Documentation.aspx page 33.
  also disconnect the device by installing the driver and plug it in when the installation is finished
