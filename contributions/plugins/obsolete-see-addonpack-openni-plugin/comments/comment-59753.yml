  I've installed all these, NITE 1.3.0.18, OpenNI 1.0.0.25, SensorKinect 5.0.0, OpenNISkeleton_3
  The nite and openni samples all run ok, but the vvvv plugin is saying Init OpenNI Node
  
  Running the NiUserTracker.exe, changes nothing, is this the right exe to run? does it still need the exe to run?
  I've checked the xml's in the plugin data folder.
  Any ideas?
