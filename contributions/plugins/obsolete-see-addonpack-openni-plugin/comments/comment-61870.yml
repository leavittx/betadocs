  Hey, got it working here. Great!
  
  I did change 
  
  ```
          <Input("Config%20File",%20DefaultString%20=%20"plugins/OpenNISkeleton/Data/SamplesConfig.xml",%20StringType=StringType.Filename%20)>
          IDiffSpread<string> FPinInConfig; 
  ```
  
  and
  
  ```
          public void initKinect()
          {
  
              kinectStarted = true;
  
              FMessage<0> = "Init OpenNI Node";
  
              this.context = new Context( FPinInConfig<0> );
  ```
  
  though, such that you don't need a reader. This way you can easily select your own config file. That worked better for me.
