  hi all, after 10 day of non-informatic life i return in the real life :))
  really great work here :DD it seems to be much more fast then the osc version. i created a little helppatch, just for creating the skeleton like the previous one. I've kept it simple, without all the thing in the old helppatch, only the skeletons and a little thumbnail of tracking.
  and happy new year to all :DDD
