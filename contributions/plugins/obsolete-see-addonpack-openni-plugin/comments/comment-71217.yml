  i just discovered that there are more joint types available on skeletons joints pin.
  
  Like "Hand Wrist" or "Hand Fingertips".
  
  But if i select one of those, the plugin gets red and throws an exception.
  
  i guess this stuff its not implemented yet in openni?  would be great to see if a hand is open or closed...
