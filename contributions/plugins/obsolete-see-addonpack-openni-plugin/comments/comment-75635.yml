  Hey People :)
  I installed openNi plugin and it was working fine...
  I removed it to change the tilt using kinect 1.0 ! and installed OpenNi plugin again... But this time only depth texture is working,,, gesture node turns red as I connect the config node to it... user and skeleton nodes dont work....
  I uninstalled open Ni and Prime Sense and everything and installed again, Clean up my registry , even removed VVVV and extracted  it again... Nothing :(
  
  would you please help?!!
  I'm using W7 64 bit and I installed the drivers inside demonstrator Kinect_OpenNI_Libary_1.1!
  
  
  Here's my log
