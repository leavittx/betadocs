  @hierro I made use of the robe package with the 1.0.25 edition.
  
  I seem to have done everything right; I get the Kinect up and running, but no skeleton appears.. Maybe there's something really obvious I'm missing.

  Edit: it seems like it's working to some extent. it finds me, looks for my pose, detects my pose, and then calibrates for ever..
