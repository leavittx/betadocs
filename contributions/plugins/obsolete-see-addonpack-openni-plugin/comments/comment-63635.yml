  I was wondering.
  I'm currently in the works of a term project for the university (an artwork going to be placed in a hospital for three weeks), in which our goal with the Kinect is to, by tracking of the hands of the user, set up an intuitive interaction with a 3D environment.
  
  We are still in the very first stages of the programming, and have discovered that the computer made available to us is not nearly as capable as we wanted it to.
  
  Anyways, the *question* is:
  Can we stop the tracking of individual joints which basically we don't need to minimize the processing done?
  
  We know that this will most probably have to be done externally of vvvv, but are eager to learn.
  
  @Everyoneishappy: Haha, we might just use that one, if pose caliberation is still needed ^^.
