  Compiled plugin already does what you are looking for, if I understood it well.
  the third texture exported is a thresholded image by a min/max zdepth, tracked upon  depthMap's histogram.
  Actually the fastest way to build 3d object using 3d info is to use the depth map, and analyze those pixels to get the correct transforms values, in example using a pipet, something like [ this](http://vimeo.com/21758978%20).
