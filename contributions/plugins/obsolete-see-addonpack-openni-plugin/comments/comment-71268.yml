  @phlegma:
  
  thx for your help phlegma! i´m glad to tell you that the kinect works again. i removed all the drivers and reinstalled it like you said - without the kinect plugged in... (even though i did it like that quite some time ago, it surprisingly works now)
  all nodes are available and nothing turns red even when i close the patch an open it again. unfortunately i cannot tell why. actually it doesn´t make that much sense - but hey... i am glad it works and hopefully it won´t crash again.
  
  thanks for your replies and for this great plugin!
