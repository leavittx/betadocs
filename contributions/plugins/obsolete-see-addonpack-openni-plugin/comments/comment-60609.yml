  Well, the first time i coded something was 3 projects ago, not so far, just wanted that fucking skeleton into vvvv :P
  
  Regarding to the hands tracking, actually u can use the handsGenerator with OpenNI.net or a sessionmanager using ManagedNite.dll, different solutions, and different results too, actuallt something is not very clear about second hands detection, matter of primary and secondary point.
  
  Sure that it will works properly with next release, i point u to the google openni forum , you can find several projects doing handstracking with kinect.
  For the skeleton...u already have it.
  
  
  PS.: grazie per il sito :D
