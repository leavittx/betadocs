  I've gone through all the xml's, some had got a little jumbled fro0m many reinstalls and overlooking, however, still the node doesn;t work...
  The modules.xml, in the plugin donwload, are from 64bit windows, so the file paths weren't right for win32, fixed those, checked all in openi and primesense all good, still issues :(
  Also tried putting the xml in an io box, as the reader wasn't always reading on startup, I'll try win64 later maybe...
