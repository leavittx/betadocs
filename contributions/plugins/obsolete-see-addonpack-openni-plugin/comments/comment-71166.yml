  hey there!
  i´ve got the same problem as kyy921 described earlier...
  some nodes turn red when connected to the context pin of the configuration node... i watched this behaviour over several hours now and i can´t figure out any regularities...
  It gets even stranger - after the first install everything worked just fine.
  When i closed the patch and reopened it again i detected the first red note.
  Tried to reinstall everything almost 5 times but that didn´t make any difference...
  
  working with beta26 and win7 x86.
  already red that phlegma is working on a compiled version for beta 26...
  
  due to its release help is much appreciated.
  thx in advance.
