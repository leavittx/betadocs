  @candian 
  had a strange behavior by installing the drivers today. this was my workaround
  
  If the automatic Kinect Driver installation fail
      -> Got to the Dive Manager an uninstall all three kinect drivers (Audio/Kamera/Motor)
      -> Scan for Hardwarechanges
      -> no they should show up with a exclamation mark or question mark
      -> Go to update drivers
      -> Browse my computer for driver software 
      -> Browse to path \PrimeSense\SensorKinect\Driver\x86
      -> Next
