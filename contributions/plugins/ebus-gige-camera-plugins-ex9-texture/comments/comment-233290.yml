  Hello Soriak !
  thanks for this plugins !
  I still have a problem.. 
  all nodes are red (listdevices-videocapture-setfeature)
  
  tty window gives me:
  Exception occurred during creation of plugin: Could not load file or assembly 'PvDotNet, Version=4.0.5.3150, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=666697f16d0ae86b' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
  
  I tried to put dll in project folder..in vvvv folder without any results...
  
  Would you have any idea about this issue ?
  
  thanks in advance !
