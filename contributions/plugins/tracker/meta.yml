  This is a simple Tracker. It can be used to stabilize blobs, handle ghost blobs and smooth the incoming data a bit. If you ever stumbled over common problems like discussed [damper-issues-when-spread-count-changes" "here](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/damper-issues-when-spread-count-changes" "here), you'll find this probably useful.
  
  The plugin comes in 2 flavours which depend on your usecase:
  ####  Tracker (ID)
  
  * when you use a tracking system that provides reliable IDs (like a fiducial tracking)
  ####  Tracker (Size)
  
  * when you use a tracking that doesn't provide an ID but gives you rectangles for each blob (like detectObject)
  * the size of those rectangles is then used to find lost blobs again.
  
  Both of them can (and must be) easily modified for other usecases... think 3d blobs or a different criteria should be used for similarity detection.
  
  That whole thing started by recreating [Daniel Shiffmans Tutorial](http://shiffman.net/general/2011/04/26/opencv-matching-faces-over-time/) which was then extended with different features.
