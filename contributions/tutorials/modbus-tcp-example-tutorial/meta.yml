  This is just a small patch that explain the basics of modbus TCP.
  
  Modbus, and now Modbus TCP is a wide spread industrial protocol which allows you to control or get data from many industrial device such as :
  - Motor driver
  - Relay board
  - Some rotary encoder
  - Wide list of sensors 
  ...
  
  This protocol as been invented by Modicon company (Schneider Electric) but it's openly published and royalty-free.
  
  This patch explain the modbus TCP only, but with a simple converter you can also control RS485 modbus devices.
  
  Hope this will help some of you.
