Hello Everybody,
i spent some days in writing this guide so you will better understand ParticlesGPU and hope will be able to customize it as you want.
this is really a pre release of the guide, it's not finished. (my laptop's GPU is dead, so i can't procede anymore..)
As soon as possible i'll post a new release of the document.

**You can download the ParticlesGPU library here:**
[particlesgpu-shader-library](xref:contribution/particlesgpu-shader-library)
