  Hello dottore. This is the second time iÂ´ve been downloading your particle - guide. The first time nothing was working.. so i thought my grafic card is not able to visualize particles.. but this was an error of mine. Now it sprays, i can see fireworks and will analyze. Is the particlesGPU_2dPositionVeloccityCycle a user - node? Thank you for your tutorial. u.
