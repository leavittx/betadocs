This is a patchswitcher we developed for the [OpenVR beginner workshop](https://17.nodeforum.org/events/open-vr-beginner/). It can handle several patches and switch them in VR with a little point-and-click interface. We used that patch during the workshop to explain several setups and usecases.


Tested with b35.8 x64 with the following packs:
- dx11
- Microdevil_Intersect
- VVVV.OpenVR
- InstanceNoodles
