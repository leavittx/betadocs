  This is a collection of flat PNG images we've used for the [Patching](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/index.html) and the [Boygrouping](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/boygrouping/index.html) wiki documentation. Most of them were just plain screenshots.
  
  Please let me know if there is one or another image missing.
  
  Best,
  Anton
