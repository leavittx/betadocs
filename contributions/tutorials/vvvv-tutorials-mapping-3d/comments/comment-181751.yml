  Hi. 
  I'm trying to follow this tutorial. 
  But the mouse and keyboard controls don't work for me. I'm not really sure how to fix the keyboard node as others have suggested. Using Window 8.1 with vvvv 3.3 64bit. 
  Can't move around the world view, I can move the projector though. But I can't set points.
