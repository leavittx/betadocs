  Hello all and thank you Elliot for this piece of technical and helpful art. 
  
  It works pretty well.
  
  **Does someone have any idea on how to display a picture in background of the Projection renderer?**
  
  I've tried in many way to do it but my background get always distorted.
  
  It would be helpful to put a picture in background in order to be able to make experimentation without having to switch on the video projector.
  
  **Edit:** I've found a way to put a picture in background, but it's dirty I can't show this... i'm sure you guys knows how to do it the clean way
