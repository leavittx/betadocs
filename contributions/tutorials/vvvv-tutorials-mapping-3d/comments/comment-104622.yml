  Just been trying this.
  
  I reach the end of calibration (with a mesh from reconstructme) and the calculated view is facing in a completely different direction from the scene.  I've tried severaltimes, with a few vvvversions.
  
  I was very precise last time ans the reprojection error was only about 1.5px, but still the view faces the wrong way.
  
  any idea?
