  thanks! unfortunately i'm already stuck loading the 3d file. actually any 3d file - not even the v.x is showing up. also no .dea, .ply or .obj files. the only files loading so far are 2-subset-cube.x and 6-subset-cube.x 
  any idea?
  
  i'm using the latest v4 + dx11- & image packs on win8.1, no red boxes.
  thank you in advance!
