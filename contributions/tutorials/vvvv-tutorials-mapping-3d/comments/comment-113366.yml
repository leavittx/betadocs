  hi everybody,
  
  thanks for the great work!
  i have a question: i`ll map a room with 2 projectors that are facing each other (each one in the opposite corner of the room).
  The 2 projectors are connected to two laptops (there is no dualhead possibility - greetings from india ;) - i plan to animate the light position and send it via osc to the 2nd laptop/beamer. Any idea how i can align the 3d coordinates of the 2 patches/projections?
  
  thank you very much!
