  PURE AVVVVESOMENESS!!!!!
  
  Got some Problems with Points in World Projector.
  Sometimes when i try moving the Points in World Projector they are kind of sticky like to a grid or something and when i create a Point they do not appear at the courser but somewhere else.
  Am i missing something?
  
  Anyway this is just great thanks so much for this contribution.
  Makes life much easier!!!!!
