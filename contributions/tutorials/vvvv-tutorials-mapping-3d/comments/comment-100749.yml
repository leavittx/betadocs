  Great Tutorial!!! Thanks Elliot.
  I'm having a problem with the world projector:
  I can't create points, or move the model in it.
  Instead of regular mouse pointer, I have only blinking red square like, that allows me to set only 1 point.
  I'll appreciate someones help on that matter.
  
  uploaded a screenshot of this issue
  
  Thanks again
