  Files from the VL Concepts and Patters workshops I + II at NODE17.
  
  The zip file contains many VL patches with comments covering a wide range of topics sorted in folders. Some .vl documents do not come with a corresponding .v4p file and must therefore dragged onto the VL window directly.
  
  Might be helpful for people who want to learn VL basics by browsing thru example patches. Also the workshop story line is contained as a PDF which should help to better grasp the content of the VL patches.
  
  The files often contain many examples, in order to get a better understanding and overview of the .vl documents always start by navigating into the document patch (ALT + P) and open the solution explorer (CTRL+J).
  
  Have fun!
