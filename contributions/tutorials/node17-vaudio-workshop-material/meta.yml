  There are three folders in the zip file:
  
  1. **_WorkshopMaterial** this is the main workshop folder with the content used and created at the workshop
  1. **AcidMachine** the Acid-techno machine demonstrated at the Keynode at NODE15: https://youtu.be/hSBx4L1LVrk?t=2h11m8s (You can hear some extra music on the video from the amazing NODE15 Keynode Band)
  1. **VideoToAudio** here you find a patch that translate a line in a video image into sound. Used in 2016 to real time modulate the image from the Eurovision Song Contest.
  
  The requirements are:
  
  VAudio pack: [vvvv.audio-pack-alpha](xref:contribution/vvvv.audio-pack-alpha)
  ASIO audio interface, if you don't have one, you can use ASIO4all http://www.asio4all.de/
  The correct architecture for the VST plugins referenced in the patches.
  
  have fun
