  In part 2 of this beginners tutorial we will continue with our previous clock tutorial and make it nice using textures. 
  
  The textures we are going to use are cut out from a picture of an alarm clock, found on the internet, the clock hands are separated and the clock is cleaned. Than they are saved as .png to keep transparency around the edges.
  
  Re-using the maths we did in Part 1 we will rebuild our clock from scratch. And please wait for part 3, because than we will add a little drop shadow to the clock hands.
