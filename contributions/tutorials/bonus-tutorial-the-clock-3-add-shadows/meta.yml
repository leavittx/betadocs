  In the final part of this Clock project, I will show you how to use a Texture Filture effect to add some shadows to our clock hands. I will show you how to make a texture out off a renderer with transparency.
  
  To be able to use the Shadow filter, be sure you have installed the Addon pack.
  
  The Trick is to give your renderer some transparency, using a setalpha (color) and setting the texture format pin, in Herr Inspector to a format that supports alpha, like A8R8G8B8.
  
  Also be sure to set the backbuffer width and height to the correct size, otherwise you image might look ugly.
