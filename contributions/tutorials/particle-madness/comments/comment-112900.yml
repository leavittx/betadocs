  hi,
  im trying to calculate time passed after emmition for each particle in the emmition CS
  so if i go  ```
  Output<index>.lifeT += dt;
  ``` 
  that gives me the lifetime of the particle, but for that index only.
  how can this value continue calculating for all the particles?
  maybe not asking this right, bit of a noob.
