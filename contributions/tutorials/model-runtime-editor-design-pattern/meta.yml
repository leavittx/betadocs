  Hello vvvvorld,
  
  Almost two years ago I started studying vl.
  I immediately realised that vl (vvvv gamma) was finally the language in which many things can be correctly expressed, allowing the user to choose the most appropriate approaches to programming without all the restrictions of vvvv beta.
  This is a collection of patches about the Model-Runtime-Editor design pattern, a convenient way to structure your software and build a flexible app architecture.
  It comes out of the research that I'm doing since 2 years about vl software development.
  During this research I had great support from the vvvv team, who helped in finding and exploring this and many other programming patterns.
  
  Here you can find a collection of video tutorials in which I go through the patches:
  - [Intro](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-intro-0-6/17597)
  - [Part 1: Model-Runtime](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-model-runtime-1-6/17598)
  - [Part 2: App](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-app-2-6/17599)
  - [Part 3: Implementing a basic Model editor](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-implementing-a-basic-model-editor-3-6/17600)
  - [Part 4: Create new Model in Patch](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-create-new-model-in-patch-4-6/17601)
  - [Part 5: UI Editor](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-ui-editor-5-6/17602)
  - [Part 6: Model over network](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-model-over-network-6-6/17603)
  
  The patches are developed in [vvvv gamma (preview](/blog/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview))
  
  Enjoy
