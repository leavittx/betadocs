  Installation instructions:
  
  - Put the unzipped folder on a location in your computer, desktop is ok. 
  
  - choose the right version of the packet. Patches are tested both on a b27 winXP machine and a b29  win7 machine. 
  
  - Basically, if you have a Emotiv EPOC (also non-research editions) you just need to install Mind Your OSC's application and Mind your OSC's RAW version-COD. It's also suggested to install Emotiv Development Kit. You can download the last version on Emotiv website ( http://www.emotiv.com/ ).
  
  - You must have at least VVVV b27 installed and working on your machine, don't forget add-ons.
  
  - Connect the emotive EPOC USB receiver, turn on the headset then launch Mind Your OSC's or  Mind your OSC's RAW version-COD if you want to work with raw EEG data.
  
  - Launch VVVV patches marked with "START" to see some practical  examples and theory on how to use EEG to control VVVV!
  
  - Enjoy :)
