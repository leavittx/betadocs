pixelshader functions resource

**v1 includes:**
* Invert
* Contrast
* Saturation: Greyscale & Saturation
* Levels
* Tonecurves

* LumaMatte: Luma & Inverse Luma
* ColorMatte

maybe a bunch of single effects, which are combining differnt functions can be avoided this way...

feedback and tell me whats missing, plz
