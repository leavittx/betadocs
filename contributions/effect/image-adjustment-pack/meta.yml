  pixelshader functions resource
  
  **v1 includes:**
  * Invert
  * Contrast
  * Saturation: Greyscale & Saturation
  * Levels
  * Tonecurves
  
  * LumaMatte: Luma & Inverse Luma
  * ColorMatte
  
  maybe a bunch of single effects, which are combining differnt functions can be avoided this way...
