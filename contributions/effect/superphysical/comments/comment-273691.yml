  [mrboni](http://vvvv.org/users/mrboni) Heya
  I am playing around with a few patches i made based on Superphysical and i do have a question:
  What would be the best way to give my object dynamic textures for lets say Albedo, roughness and so on?
  In the help patches there is a ToPointer node that gets a bang on the start but how can i do it for every frame?
  
  Thanks!
