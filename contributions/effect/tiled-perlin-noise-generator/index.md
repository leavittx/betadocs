Patch to generate a stitchable perlin noise using flash.

Flash 10 has a function to generate stitchable perlin noise textures.

VVVV talks to flash using XML sockets. 

Loads of settings to play with.

See more on the function here http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/display/BitmapData.html#perlinNoise%28%29
