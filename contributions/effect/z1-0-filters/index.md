There are some texture filters I used in my previous work:

**filterBlurredContours:**
Draws an image from continuous lines.

**filterContour:**
Finds a contour, or edges on a picture.

**filterEdge:**
Just a high-pass filter.

**filterOneSideLine:**
Draws a border line around white places on a picture.

**filterSlowDown:**
surprisingly **very useful** effect
It's handy to slow down visual effect. It can make a motion blur, or it can slowly show your effect instead of to let it appear suddenly.
