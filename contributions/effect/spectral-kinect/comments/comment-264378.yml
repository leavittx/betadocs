  Cool effect.  I was scratching my head getting this to work with Kinect2, but it was much easier than I thought.  Make sure you have DX11 pack installed, then on the root Spectral Kinect patch make a Kinect2 Device node, connect the Runtime to a Kinect2 Skeleton, then connect the JointPositionXYZ to the Resample Skeleton input, and you're golden!  Make sure to delete or disable the old Skeleton from the old Kinect version.
