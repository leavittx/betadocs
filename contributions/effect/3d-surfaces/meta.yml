  This is a straight port from the old contribution made by [sanch](http://vvvv.org/users/sanch), [desaximundi](http://vvvv.org/users/desaximundi) and [tonfilm](http://vvvv.org/users/tonfilm) in 2007 (see legacy shaders) in DX9. More than 50 differents surfaces now with gsfx for DX11!
  As we have now DX11 and GeometryShaderFX it has a huge potential, you can use it like any other standard 3D primitives (grid, box, sphere, etc.). Try it with Microdee's DX11 MRE and have fun !
