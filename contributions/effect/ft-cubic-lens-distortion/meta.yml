  A straight 'port' of Francois Tarliers really nice ft Cubic Lens Distortion. The original shader was written in PixelBender which seems to be a fancy-shmancy adobe word for hlsl. Also included are some PS 2.0 techniques which feature different subsets of the full PS 3.0 implementation and could be handy when one wants to save some precious gpu cycles.
  Cheers to dEp for accidentally reminding me that i had this shader! ;)
