  I would like to get this working.. however there are 3 nodes which are somewhat red in the middle, and grey along top/bottom:
  onlyColorWorldXYZ, Ord2Enum, and another copy of onlyColorWorldXYZ. 
  At first they were bright red, but after hovering over them and seeing where it wanted to find the files, I copied them into the appropriate dirs.
  Reopened jonKinectPointCloud (which btw I put that file into the main vvv dir, not sure if thats the right place to put it).
  
  Can someone direct me in the right direction? I have been wanting to add my Kinect to my VJ shows ever since I bought the thing a few months ago. I searched all over the net to find an app that would let me do some effects with it (like this one) and found vvvv. So far I really like the vvvv concept.
  
  Edit:
  When I view the source code for onlyColoredWorldXYZ.fx it shows an error at the bottom of the window:
  DepthToWorld: ps_2_a does not support doubles
  
  WTF ??
