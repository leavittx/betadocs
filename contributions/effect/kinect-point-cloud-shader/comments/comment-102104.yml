  this does not working in 45beta30x86?
  
  I'm using kinect by openNI driver.
  I knew these drivers stable and I am using these drivers.
  Kinect
  OpenNI-win32-1.5.2.23-redist
  SensorKinect-Bin-Win32-v5.1.0.25
  NITE 1.5.2.21
  
  Depth(openNI) help, Skeleton(openNI) help patch work well.
  but this point cloud patch does not work.
  first time, I found three node red.
  but as [RoyCui](http://vvvv.org/users/RoyCui) comment, I fixed that. then no red node. looks normal.
  but in renderer, nothing shown.
  
  could you give me any help for me?
