  Great work! seems very interesting. I've managed to use Multiskeleton(kinect). but not KinectskeletonPointCloud. I'm hunting the solution since a few hours... Shall i run the NiUserTracker.exe from multiskeleton? or maybe OpenNISkeleton.csproj ? but i can't run it, I should install Visual studio i guess. maybe someone could help me?
