Interactive installation made with vvvv and controlled by a Microsoft Kinect. This project is part of my research in interactive material and has been exhibited for the first time during B-Seite festival in Mannheim (Germany).

Thanks a lot to those four guys for their amazing contribution : 
Natan Sinigaglia for his GPU texture field particle system.
Unc for his amazing pixel shader.
Martin Zrcek for the Ciant 3D Particle.
And Vux for the Kinect plugin, and a lot more.

The kinect plugin is not included, in case you want to use this effect with Kinect, you just need the Depth Texture, also this was made with beta 28.1.

In case you have something different than the screenshot above, try to tweak parameters on the "Colorize" and "Glow" textureFX, I noticed that they can create different effect depending on ... something that I will find out one day. :)
