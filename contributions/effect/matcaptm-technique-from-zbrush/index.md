What if you could create a surface material and lighting environment simply by painting an object so that it looks like you want it to look? What if you could create that surface material by sampling points from an existing image that already features the material and lighting environment you want?

* No tedious tweaking of numerical material values.
* No need to set up any lights.

For a great many (probably the majority) materials and lighting environments, this is exactly what MatCap™, a ZBrush proprietary feature, allows you to do.
