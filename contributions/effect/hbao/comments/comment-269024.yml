  what tekcor said..
  followed the fixes from the comments but still the same error :/
  
  edit: ok silly me, have replaced the core folders from the google drive download. but of course you have just to add the vcruntime140d.dll to the folders. @tekcor maybe you were silly too ;) it works now..
  
  edit2: Anyway the demo scene eats 100% of my GTX 1050 at 25fps.. :/
