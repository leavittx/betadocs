  hey idwyr!
  
  nice work, i really like the cloud conversion and would like to use it.
  does the camera needs to be within the shader or can it be outsourced as well?
  since i am not as good in hlsl yet, i was wondering if you or anyone in this community would be able to take out the camera so the shader can be used with a camera (transform softimage) attached to the renderer. my attempts weren't too successful yet. i'll keep trying. thx
