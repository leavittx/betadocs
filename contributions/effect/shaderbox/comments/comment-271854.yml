  Hey avilahuerta,
  
  Sorry for the late answer. Basically buffers on Shadertoy are multiple passes, which means that you first render texture in a BufferA and pass it further to next buffer or a final shader part. I'm not aware if vvvv's hlsl implementation still does not support multiple passes. Probably not.
  
  There is a basic workaround [Multiple Passes](xref:39838eb2-c610-47d7-ad8f-79c7bdb2cda4)
  Just split the whole shader to several parts according to number of buffers and pass texture from one shader to another.
