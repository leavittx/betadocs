  Hello,
  
  Thanks for your contribution. I had played myself with shadertoy shaders and ported to VVVV but with shaderbox it is easier. I have one question: i have seen in shadertoy that some shaders have buffers (bufferA, bufferB, ...). So far I did not manage to conevrt those shaders to be used in VVVV. Do you have suggestions on how to do it?.
  
  Thanks a lot.
