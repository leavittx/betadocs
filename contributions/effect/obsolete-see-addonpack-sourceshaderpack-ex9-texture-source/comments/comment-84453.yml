  Hi lecloneur
  thanks for these modules and shaders!
  I have a problem with Electricity:
  
  ![Noise??](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/Preview%20%28EX9.Texture%29-DirectX%20Renderer.png)
  
  I checked the old electricity shader and it's the same, vertex noise doesn't work...
  
  I'm on Nvidia Quadro 2000
  
  Does anybody know ho w to fix this?
  
  Tnx
  Bye
