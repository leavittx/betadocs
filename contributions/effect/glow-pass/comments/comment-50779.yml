  gotta second the multithreading! i'll look into arkanos current version over the next week and see what i can do.
  
  since i haven't heard any official announcements concerning a dx10/11 renderpath could anybody fill me in?
  
  also this might be a good moment to move this conversation to the forum.. (where i probably should have posted in the first place..)
