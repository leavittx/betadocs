  Hello Dottore,
  only a question, in the 3d surface shader, would it be possible to adapt it for using flat shading instead phong?
  
  how?
  
  thanks

  i mean if would it be possible to implement the flat shading in the 3d sufaces based in the original grid size?.
  
  Other possibility (but not the same that flat shading) is using the normal map without bicubic interpolation, but when i use a texture on the shader it looks distorted. 
  
  thanks
  
  ari.
