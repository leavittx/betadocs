  hi lasal,
  actually it's really easy to add an image texture on the Bicubic resampled surface (is that you mean?):
  in the shader just add a new texture+sampler.
  then in the pixel shader multiply the color (from Phong function) with the tex2D(sampler of your texture, texCoord). 
  you can use the same texcoord i'm using to sample the position texture.
  
  :)
