  @sinus: strange, is this happening with beta25 plus addons pack?
  
  @hrovac: because we are using directly the GPU, there are many problems related to each graphic card. 
  in general i saw that ParticlesGPU on multiscreen is problematic: seams there's no way to share a rendered texture between two different screens; so if we evaluate the position texture (in your case the Queue shader+renderer) on the first monitor, we can't send this texture to the second screen (where there's the final render).
  Try to keep all the renderer in the same screen (moving the renderer windows), also if just one goes to fullscreen.
  As i said, it could also depend on your specific graphic card...
  hope this will help you.
  best
