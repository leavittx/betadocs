  helo,
  
  i tried to use the ParticlesGPU_Shader_Queue at the second graphicCard output and i got a lot of errors.
  TTY said:
  "access violation at adress 0043B4CA
  error in the layer ParticlesGPU_Shader_Queue.fx"
  and
  when closing vvvv: "Exception EInvalidPointer in module vvvv.exe at 000047C9"
  or
  "Exception EAccess violation in module ntdll.dll at 0001B21A
  access violation at adress 7C91B21A in module 'ntdll.dll'. Write of address 00000010."
  or
  "Exception EAccess violation in module vvvv.exe at 0000480C.
  access violation at adress 0040480C in module 'vvvv.exe' Read of address FFFFFFFC."
  
  is it just me and my NVidia GeForce 8800GTX in DualViewMode (XP32bit)
  or someone else got the same problem?
  
  when using the last renderer at screen1 it works
