This Shader Library comes from a research i did in these 2 years on possibilities offered by GPU.
You will find classic particle systems via GPU but this is not the end, it's just the beginning: with a similar approach you are able to create many algorithms, shapes, behaviours...not just "particles".

Look into the Readme File for change log.

**Here you find a sort of guide to the basic elements of this ParticlesGPU approach:**
