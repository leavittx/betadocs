  Gooch-style "diffuse" with a glossy vertex-applied shading. The highlight is done in VERTEX shading -- not as a texture. Glossiness is controlled not only by the usual power function, but also by applying a set of gloss controls that cause a sharp falloff across a specified range. The falloff will occur in the highlight range glossBot-glossTop and the amount of falloff is specified by "glossDrop." Setting "glossDrop" to 1.0 nullifies the effect.
