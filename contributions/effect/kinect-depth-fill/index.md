Fill up those black spots in the depth image of the Kinect.
Useful for filtering before using the Kinect depth as a displacement texture.

This is still a bit rough around the edges, and I'll most likely update it in time, but it might be useful to people as it is already. :)

/edit:
Thanks to [tmp](http://vvvv.org/users/tmp) and their massive [dx11.pointcloud](xref:contribution/dx11.pointcloud) contribution, this version should be just plain better, enjoy :)
