  this reacts to world-, view-, projection-, aspect ratio transformation and dynamic meshes too.
  
  the help patch is a bit lame but i hope that shows well how to use this.
  have fun!:)
  
  update:
  i've done some minor fixes and cleanups and i solved the ugly edges by smoothing the velocity map. also i discovered that the blur of the movement on Z axis was incorrect when perspective was used so that's fixed too.
  
  update2:
  revamped the whole thing: now it's nicer and has more control. still it has some ghosts caused by the blur though.
  
  update3:
  added blur filter instead of the gaussianblur, added more control to velocitymaps, corrected this and that
  
  update4:
  i discovered after this long time that the direction of the blurring was not always right and it was annoying. so it's fixed now and it's way much nicer.
