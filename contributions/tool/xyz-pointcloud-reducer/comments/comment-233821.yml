  I was so amazed when I saw Photosynt for the first time
  I remember this post of 2012 https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/photosynth-pointcloud-successfully-imported-to-vvvv/8559/13
  On the end of the post I said I was about to take pictures of a huge landmark
  A few years latter Pix4d was popular, this is the result

  If a webbrowser can render that... why not vvvv? well, because im doing it so wrong :P
  I will give it a try latter, thanks for your help, and btw, great contribution
