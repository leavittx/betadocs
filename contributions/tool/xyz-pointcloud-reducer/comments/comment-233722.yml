  @andresc4 converting the pointcloud into dds and visualizing it is quite straight forward. later it would be cool to have some octree system to visualize even extra large (30M+) pointclouds.
  
  this tools was made for services that have limit on maximum file size and work only with text pointclouds. :) 
  obviously, you want to compress the file when possible. 7z gave me the best results.
