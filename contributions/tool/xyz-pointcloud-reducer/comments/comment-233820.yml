  @beyon sure, it does round the values, same function as FormatValue node.

  @andresc4 Yes, FileTexture and shaders. Many DX9 particle systems actually used bitmaps/textures to store the values. This one for example [ciantparticles-16000000p-gpu-particle-system- -rotations.](xref:contribution/ciantparticles-16000000p-gpu-particle-system- -rotations.) In DX11 shader, you would use Load function instead of SampleLevel to read the values from texture. But that is for another contribution ;)
