  Hi VVVVolks, 
  
  this is my very first contribution ;)
  i startet this project during a boring exhibition standy job to expand my patching skills and create a useful tool for me... 
  i am an absolute patching beginner, so maybe there are some nodes and wires that a pro would patch in another way :)
  
  
  Basic Features:
  - calculate a projection (overlap, optic ratio, pixelsize)
  - configure a testpattern for the calculated projection with:
  
  * grid
  * outlines
  * circles
  * softedge markers
  * crosses
  * text
  
  
  I am curious about feedback and maybe there are some videotechnicans out there who could use this generator...
