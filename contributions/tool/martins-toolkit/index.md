**Enabled**- damps values to quickly blend quads - super usefull - this is the best :)
**Pillow**- as lightweight as a quad, can make a nice glow around, or shadow
**Print**- simple print method using IrfanView. (all print parameters stay from last print, so you can set them in external program)
**TreeSpread**- Like a LinearSpread, but values "split to 2" in phases.
**LogAll**- Printing all the vvvv memory and CPU info to a text file to debug.
**Attract**- like a damper, but framebased, open (see inside and adapt to your needs) and sometimes damper gives me unexpected results (example is in help patch)
**InputMorph** and **Damper** (Transform) - to morph and damp matrices by conversion to quaternions
