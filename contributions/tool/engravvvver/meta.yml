  ## Engravvvver GCode Generator
  
  The Engravvvver is a vvvv patch that reads a pixel image (.BMP / .JPG / .PNG / etc) 
  and converts it into a machine-readable GCode path for 2D raster engraving. Every GCode is saved incrementally within the folder of the source image.
  
  **You can**
  
  *   set the laser power (min/max) from 0-255
  *   set the travel and feed rate
  *   set the scan resolution (pixel size in mm),
  *   define a cutout shape (quad/circle) as well as cutout speed and power
  *   see the graphical representation of the gcode line that is currently being written
  * generate GCode files (yay!), these can be quite large!!
  
  **You can not**
  *   achieve a higher feed rate than the max amount of gcode lines per second that your machine can receive
  *   send the gcode "on-the-fly" to a device (I use Universal GCode Sender **2.0**  <https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender>)
