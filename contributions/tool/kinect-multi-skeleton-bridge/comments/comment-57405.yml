  well, what i can say is that we are having pain in the ass to use those rotations into unity, maybe for a lack of experience on matrix and quaternion, and also cos unity is an unclear platform, anyway openNi has  a 3x3 matrix respect orientation, and we are assuming that rotation XYZ are on the first column of that matrix
  
  rotationX=matrix<0>
  rotationY=matrix<3>
  rotationZ=matrix<6>
  
  anyway is not working clean actually :)
