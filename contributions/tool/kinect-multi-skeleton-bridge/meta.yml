  2)MultiSkeleton (Kinect) help.v4p
  
  What you need :
  
  - OpenNi framework
  - PrimeSense sensor driver kinect mod

  Note: This is just a quick hack to play, PrimeSense and OpenNi will release more "tools" and documentation to do that easier; wrapping the program into a vvvv plugin will be helpful too(less latency and direct control within vvvv).
