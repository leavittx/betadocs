  I think this project is more or less dead, at least there have been very little activity and the download is from june 2012.
  
  Try downloading the last version of vvvv from before june 2 2012: https://vvvv.org/blog/vvvv45beta27.2 maybe it works with that version.
  
  EDIT: Perhaps @milo can tell about the status of IRIS
