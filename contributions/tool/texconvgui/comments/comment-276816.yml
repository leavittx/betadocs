  hi, a really usefull tool indeed, but it hardly works for me, i try it at a couple of different computers, i tried it hundreds of times, it worked only a few times. Dont know how and why.
  
  I am trying to convert a sequance of png with alpha to dds . as i said it worked a few times.. 
  
  i tried using simple folder names and file names like C:\chips and to save the dds file to the same or a different folder again in C: 
  
  it just says done and nothing happens. help
