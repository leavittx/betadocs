  Hi there,
  
  Thanks for this useful tool!
  
  As far as I know texConv is the most convenient conversion tool atm to take advantage of the last BC formats, because :
  - as you say nvtt still has no support of BC6H and BC7 formats
  - Compressonator is unusable on my machine (Win7 with Windows kit 10 installed), as versions 3.0+ require DX12 and Vulkan, and v2.5/2.6 crash at the end of textures' generation...
  
  Could you share the code of this tool, or add a few improvements to it? The first one I see would be to automatically choose the right number of mipmaps if this number is set (by default) to 0. Indeed the generator fails to convert files if you set a higher number than it's possible to generate, which is quite annoying when you want to convert textures with various resolutions in the same folder.
