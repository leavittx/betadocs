  hey motzi,
  
  thanks for the feedback! i just pushed a new release that solves the path issue by displaying a popup if the folder does not exist, and makes the toggles a bit less ambiguous by setting unchecked color to a soft grey.. this is not ideal of course, I guess it would be better to have some sort of icon, but Elementa does not allow this for now :)
