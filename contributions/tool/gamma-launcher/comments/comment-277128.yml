  hey there!
  
  sebl also reported this issue that the dropdown does now work well if you have too many gamma versions, but we don't have a proper scrollbar thingy in elementa for now (working on it...). 
  
  solution I came up with for now is to have the dropdown menu scrollable when it's closed : simply hover it and use the scrollwheel to cycle through installed versions (kinda like beta enums). that was added in 3.3.0.
  
  regarding ordering, i'll definitely reverse that so that newer versions are on top, makes much sense indeed. also, note that when you re-open the launcher, it will be in the same state as when you left it, including the version displayed in the dropdown.
