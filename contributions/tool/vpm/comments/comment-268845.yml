  I've got a problem with VPM not getting further than 'Initialization complete'. 
  It happens with any pack, including packs without dependencies. 
  I'm on a new machine, new vvvv install 50beta37x64. Latest VPM version. 
  VPM was extracted with 7zip. The registering process seemed to work ok. 
  The .vpm folder gets created in the vvvv_50beta37_x64 directory and gets populated with pack subfolders.
  
  Regular git clone works
