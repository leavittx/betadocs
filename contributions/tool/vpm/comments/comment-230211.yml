  Interesting but still very much alpha it seems. Would really need to have some version info for packs.
  
  Seems you can have arbitrary c# code in a .vpack? Powerful but also seems a bit like handing over your keys to your house to the author from a security perspective but with curated package repo it might be ok.
  
  If you use the latest_alpha packs to install vvvv it seems like it will just copy new files over an existing vvvv directory with no cleaning up of files not used by a newer version?
