  It sounds good and I totally understand the reasoning behind it. I do however see a potential problem(as with all these cases about licenses everything is potential problems and I guess that is why you make licenses in the first place).
  
  CC is originally made for music and similar creative output. Where a work you have created can be released for other to remix if they only share alike. what the musician is not obligated to share though is his/her instrument.
  
  I could imagine me being asked to make a performance in a dome, since this contribution is made it would be the logical step to use this to modify my performance patch to work in a dome. I have no problem releasing my output under a CC license, but in this case I would need to release my "instrument", which is what gives my visuals my "distinct look". since the license says SA.
  
  Of course if I improve on the Dome Tool itself, it makes sense, but I don't necessarily think that the patching I use to create the creative output should be CC as well... a bit like releasing a movie projector where everything you show on it becomes CC.
  
  Is this the case or am I interpreting the license the wrong way?
  
  In other words, are you sure you mean the SA part?
  
  Or does the SA part only apply to changes made to the Dome contribution itself or?
  
  Please read this note positively, I am all for open licenses, but the right ind for the right place.
