  Dear [joreg](http://vvvv.org/users/joreg)
  
  i tried using bad mapper again and it still an absolutely awesome patch, but i wonder can i use multiple texture or source to the badmapper and have different polygon for every texture? for example i use texture A for polygon 0 and switch to texture B for polygon 1 and so on. 
  
  thank you
