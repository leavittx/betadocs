  Hey Aurel,
  
  I've just tried clean install of beta37 x86, DX11 pack, Image pack.
  When I click Solve, the node turns red.
  Then, when I copy the nvcuda.dll into the Image pack folder (see the detailed description above) and restart vvvv, everything works. Unfortunately the link to the .dll from the @teckor site doesn't work anymore.
  
  This is how the problem solves on my machine.
  
  Hope this helps a bit.
  
  Best,
  Anton
