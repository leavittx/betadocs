  my xmas present to the vvvv community, a patch to control Android devices! use it to cheat with games , flood friends with repeated greetings messages or whatever you'd find it usefull for :)
  
  It requires a usb cable, usb debugging enabled and a recent android version to fully work, the remote screen is slow to update because of the method used to pull the screenshot from the device.
  There is another method but getting the data it's tricky and i couldn't get it working that way, red more about it here:
