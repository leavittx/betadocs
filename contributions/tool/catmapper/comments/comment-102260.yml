  @Hadasi I delete the help patch for the renderer, simple fix, it was built for a stand alone app, so f1 was allowable!
  Really I'd like to have a node to disable v4 shortcuts, so you can use copy and paste, and ctl z with out issues, currently keyboard control is iffy, you can pretty much only use keys without modifiers, or use atl+ctl, which is an arse too! But feel free to alter the key mappings ;)
  Thanks for the feedback, fixed the issue ( Its a multiply by 0 rather than missing links, if you hadn't used your mouse wheel to zoom, it was broken)
  Also fixed shadows not working on ATI too...
  Try it again and see if that fixes it for you...
