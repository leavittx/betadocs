  thanks to all who developed it! just wanted to leave short notice that it works really well for me in vvvv_50beta35 :)
  
  
  one question: is it possible to use multiple kinects with the hitboxes (maybe doublicate kinect part and select another index.. integrate into the 3d view?!) ;D They dont have to overlap, I just would like to cover a bigger area side by side, then I send the OSC-Signals to Resolume Layers etc
