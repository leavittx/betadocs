  Little tool to check and modify the windows system timer.
  
  If you want to know what this is about, you should read this article:
  [Windows Timer Resolution: Megawatts Wasted](http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/windows-timer-resolution-megawatts-wasted/)
  
  The matter is in my opinion less dramatic as the author of the article states, but he has written down a comprehensive collection of facts about the windows timer. Excellent article!
  
  Source code is here: <https://github.com/tebjan/TimerTool>
  
  Verison 3 minimizes to system tray and can be started with command line arguments "-t peroidVal" and "-minimized". e.g. put a .bat file into your autostart with the following code:
  
  ```
  start "" "C:\PathToTool\TimerTool.exe" -t 0.5 -minimized
  exit
  ```
  
  Version 2 can set 0.5 ms as timer resolution.
