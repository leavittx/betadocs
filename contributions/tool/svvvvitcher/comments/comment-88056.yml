  Thanks a lot, Is fantastic, works very well in the pc (i3 1gb radeon) with nanoKorg and using a web cam. But when connecting the projector the mouse "jumps" with some patches and it is impossible to handle: the frames down to 4 ... I tried it on several laptops, the latter is i7 NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M. 
  Any solutions? Graphics card may not be enough?
  (Forgive my English, google translator is not god)
  No problem for new patches or effects, no problem with nanoKOrg (mapped with the midi learn)
