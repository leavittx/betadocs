  I am trying to get this to work with multiple chords simultaneously, to have a spread of keys pressed, rather then just one at a time. 
  
  Max for live comes with the connection kit, which has a MIDI out, which sends midi slightly differently, but I am not completely across how to unpack the notes and velocities into spreads. 
  
  "OSC MIDI Send â€“ sends MIDI note and velocity data as OSC messages to a Processing sketch."
  
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
