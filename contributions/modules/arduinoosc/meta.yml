  Patch and code to use Z_Osc library with arduino and vvvv.
  
  It needs :
  Arduino Osc library 
  https://github.com/djiamnot/Z_OSC 
  Arduino Ethernet shield and library 
  http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield
  
  I add 2 more examples to control Arduino pins from Iphone via iOSC http://recotana.com/iphone/iosc/en/index.html
  and with TouchOsc http://hexler.net/software/touchosc 
  although not vvvv directly related i thought interesting to have it all together .
