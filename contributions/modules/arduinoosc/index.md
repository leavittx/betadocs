Patch and code to use Z_Osc library with arduino and vvvv.

It needs :
Arduino Osc library 
https://github.com/djiamnot/Z_OSC 
Arduino Ethernet shield and library 
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield

I add 2 more examples to control Arduino pins from Iphone via iOSC http://recotana.com/iphone/iosc/en/index.html
and with TouchOsc http://hexler.net/software/touchosc 
although not vvvv directly related i thought interesting to have it all together .
