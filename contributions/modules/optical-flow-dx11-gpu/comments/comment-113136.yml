  hey thx for the feedback. 
  
  The Shader calculates a certain offset in x and y for each pixel. The hue color coding would imply that we calculate from this x and y values a certain angle which represents a particular hue color.
  i do believe its sth like this 
  
  float angle = atan2(y,x);
  
  now when we reuse the optical flow in the next pass or shader we often use the individual vector to distort the image or for example to accelerate particles in a certain direction. in order to do so, we then need to restore the x and y for the acceleration from this angle again.
  
  Hence we would convert the x and y into an angle in order to restore the x and y later from that angle. Which is think is redundant. (correct me if im wrong)
  
  another problem is that this unneeded conversion is doen via atan which ( like sin,cos, log or texture lookups) increases the cost per pixel tremendously.
