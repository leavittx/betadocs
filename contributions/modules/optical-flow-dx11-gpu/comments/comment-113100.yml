  hmm if i did everything right then the x value should be in r and the y channel in g of the colored texture ... plus and minus should be available in 32 bit float tex. i think a compute shader would be necessary - like the pipet example in dx11 ...MAYBE ...and then read back ...but i think someone who is more experienced could jump in this topic...sorry if that didnt help
