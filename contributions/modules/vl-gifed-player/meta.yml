  GIFed is a tiny dotnet library wich allows to read and save gifs,
  https://github.com/SirTony/Gifed
  I ported it to vl as and exercise , and finally I FOUND  it works at a very high performance, we can use it in vl or vvvv as texture and it allows to plays gifs from local files or URLs, and save them at original framerare and size .
  I use it as replacement for skia gif reader loader, cos of load times.
  
  Is part from GIF.mixer im preparing and you can see in the forums.
  I always missed a gif media player inside 4v so i made my own.
  Open examples patch for use guide. i include some assets to test.
  Enjoy!
  
  Requires last alpha.
