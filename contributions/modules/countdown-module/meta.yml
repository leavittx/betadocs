  This comes in handy for me every now and then so I thought I should share it.
  I edited [sunep](http://vvvv.org/users/sunep)'s version where the conversion from hh:mm:ss to seconds and back didn't work correctly.
  I fixed that, tidied up and altered the module a bit to my preferrence.
  
  Have fun with it and thanks [sunep](http://vvvv.org/users/sunep) for creating the initial version.
