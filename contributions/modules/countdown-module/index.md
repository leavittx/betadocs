This comes in handy for me every now and then so I thought I should share it.
I edited [sunep](http://vvvv.org/users/sunep)'s version where the conversion from hh:mm:ss to seconds and back didn't work correctly.
I fixed that, tidied up and altered the module a bit to my preferrence.

Have fun with it and thanks [sunep](http://vvvv.org/users/sunep) for creating the initial version.
