Hi,

while working with some Students at the HFG Offenbach, I had problems with recent Arduinos and Firmata.
Although i thought it would be better for beginners to have an even simpler Version of Firmata, which can't be reconfiguered. Thats why I decided to write a new basic and simpe Firmata. The BasicMata.
The code is maximum simple and doesnt apply any non standard functions. The Protocoll is based on the PING/PONG paradigm. More info here: http://code.google.com/p/basicmata/wiki/BasicMataIntroduction

Since I'am working mostly with VVVV [/](https://vvvv.org/404) I added a module for it.
It would be cool to have such a Demo for Processing, PD, Max, OF and whatever as well ....
So if You could do some Demo please contribute! Become a contributor: http://code.google.com/p/basicmata/
And I really love to here if this little code block is working well for You!

Sketch vvvv modul and infos in the zip-file. Recent versions miight be found here:
```
svn checkout http://basicmata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ basicmata-read-only
```
