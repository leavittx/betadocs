  Hi,
  
  while working with some Students at the HFG Offenbach, I had problems with recent Arduinos and Firmata.
  Although i thought it would be better for beginners to have an even simpler Version of Firmata, which can't be reconfiguered. Thats why I decided to write a new basic and simpe Firmata. The BasicMata.
  The code is maximum simple and doesnt apply any non standard functions. The Protocoll is based on the PING/PONG paradigm. More info here: http://code.google.com/p/basicmata/wiki/BasicMataIntroduction
  
  Since I'am working mostly with VVVV [/](https://vvvv.org/404) I added a module for it.
  It would be cool to have such a Demo for Processing, PD, Max, OF and whatever as well ....
  So if You could do some Demo please contribute! Become a contributor: http://code.google.com/p/basicmata/
  And I really love to here if this little code block is working well for You!
  
  Sketch vvvv modul and infos in the zip-file. Recent versions miight be found here:
  ```
  svn checkout http://basicmata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ basicmata-read-only
  ```
