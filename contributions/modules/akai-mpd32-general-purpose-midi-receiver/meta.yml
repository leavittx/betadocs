  This patch collects all MIDI Input from an Akai MPD32 and serves them in a convenient way.
  I use to scroll down and use frameless Mode (<[Ctrl>-<8>) to have a view on 
  current values (fitting 1080 screen lines)
  * The drum pads trigger regular Bangs as well as a sustaining signal ("hold" until Note Off)
     and an ordinal of the last pressed Pad, together with four Bangs telling which Pad Bank is active.
  * The beat uses MPDs Clock. Hit the <[PLAY> transport button on the device and <[TAP%20TEMPO>.
  * Choose one of 7 slices of the Beat Bangs to synchronize parameters of your Set from 1/16th up to 4/1. 
  * All values are exported per Output Pin as well as per <span class="node">S (Value)</span>.
  
  Currently i haven't installed the Vyzex Software to attach the MPD preset in the proprietary format. If you experience problems uploading the SysEx, let me know.
  
  Have fun, any feedback welcome.
