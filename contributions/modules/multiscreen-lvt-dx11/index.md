####  Notice
* Thanks to [catweasel](http://vvvv.org/users/catweasel) for the great MultiscreenCat 

* Thanks to Xucong for testing & feedback http://surrealred.com/

* I don't know how to use the node Text(DX11) properly because it seems to display in a fixed font size. You can use hotkey "f + left / right" to change the font size if needed.  

* Tested on vvvv 33.7 x86 & 34.2 x86.

* Open the help patch to see how it works.

* Hope you feel it useful.
