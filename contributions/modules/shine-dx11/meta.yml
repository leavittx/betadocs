  This is my first approach to hlsl in dx11, its just a ported effect from GPU gems 3.
  A good exercise to understand some basics of dx11 on shading programming.
  I would like to update the shader with same parameters from the famous Shine effect from trapcode.

  But still dont have the skills to do it, so i just share it for this nice community.
  Any tip would be super.
  Enjoy!
