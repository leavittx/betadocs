  This series of patches forms part of a video mixer project im working on, 
  i tried to create them to easily integrate in any project, all modules have a    minimal GUI,and are optimized for performance, hope people find it useful.
  
  -GridVideo : Allow to select Quicktime movies with vj style in the folder you choose.It includes a ffmpeg powered thumbnail generator to make things easier.
  -BPM Tap : Simple Tapper.
  -Audio Tool : Complete audio analysis with Hysteresis tool and range selector.Awesome response at the speed of sound.
  
  at the moment there are several modules planned for release soon:
  
  -LFO.
  -Spreader.
  -Layer system.
