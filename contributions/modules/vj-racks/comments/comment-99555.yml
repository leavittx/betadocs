  @geometrica, yes I know but it just that if I don't want to tap but just reset the beat on a snare or on the bass for example. Need to tap once on time but not tap the beat again, well this is how I made my tap bpm. Good job anyway, looking forward to try the others modules I see on the screenshot :)
