  Updated to include DX11 in the help patch. Added some yaw to the movement, as well as damper. Altered patch to more closely match the current softimage reset, and keyboard and mouse. It's a bit more like a FPS shooter, meets flight sim now.

  It copies camera/view behavior from this tool: <http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=12511>
  I got really used to it, and finally made this module to fly around 3d
  Kinda works like no-clip mode in FPS games
  
  dunno, maybe somebody will find it handy too
  
  just hold LMB, fly with WASD, move mouse to look/turn around
  
  CONTROLS: (Updated 8/11/2015 SuperflysiNZ)

  look - LMB+MOUSEMOVE
