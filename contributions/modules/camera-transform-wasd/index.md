It copies camera/view behavior from this tool: <http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=12511>
I got really used to it, and finally made this module to fly around 3d
Kinda works like no-clip mode in FPS games

dunno, maybe somebody will find it handy too

just hold LMB, fly with WASD, move mouse to look/turn around

CONTROLS: (Updated 8/11/2015 SuperflysiNZ)
fly - WASD
look - LMB+MOUSEMOVE
pan - MMB+MOUSEMOVE
fov - z+RMB+MOUSEMOVE
strafe - RMB+MOUSEMOVE
fast = SHIFT+WASD
r(hold) = reset view
