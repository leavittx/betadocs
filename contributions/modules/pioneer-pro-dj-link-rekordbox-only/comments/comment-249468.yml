  do you have a djm and a cdj to test?
  
  djm should send packets with the length 82 where you can see on bytes 78-81 if the volume fader is > 0.
  but your network card needs to be in promiscuous mode to get all the packets. 
  
  have a look at the nodes i did years ago - could you test them? https://files.bildwerk.tv/PioneerDemo.zip
  
  Also we should continue this at another place - i would suggest riot (user bildwerk) or skype (in profile).
