  @bildwerk ohh,,, that the trick...
  I just spend several hours looking at wireshark looking for nothing
  It seems that the CDJ need some kind of querry to get the track title
  Next time I have access to 2 of them I will give it a try
  I found the CDJ name in one packet, at 50000 port, not 50001 , also the mixer does the same
  but not other message was sent from the mixer no matter that I move
