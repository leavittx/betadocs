  I needed a proper and artifact-less way of creating spherical landscapes and i thought the best way to realize it is using cubemaps. unfortunately current DX11 implementation misses rendering to proper cube textures so i utilized volume textures for the same task.
  It's pure hackery but seems to be working.
