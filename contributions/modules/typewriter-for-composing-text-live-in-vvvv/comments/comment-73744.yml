  hey bo27, i searched on the forums but couldn't find it, so i put together this module, might be educational for someone else! just checked your plugin, impressive and all another beast compared to this gargantuos  module. yor it's soo advanced at a point that i didn't figure out how to just type live while testing it 5 minutes :) will check more the help patch!
  Indeed this module is a lot limited compared to yours but you just plug and play without many pins or advanced options to learn. it also has no dependancies since it's all vvvv based.
  
  maybe i should rename this to Simple/lazy/easy typewriter?
  If one day renderer(TTy) could output the string of what you type into it both our works could be not needed anymore ;) devvvvs?
