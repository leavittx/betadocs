  ####  ffmpegInfo
  
  **ffmpegInfo**is running *ffprobe.exe* in the background to extract video file information, then parses the result once, when the program has completed its execution.
  
  
  
  ####  ffmpegConvert
  
  **ffmpegConvert**first run **ffmpegInfo**to extract videofile information, then, when it is completed, builds command line arguments, at the second stage the patch is starting ffmpeg.exe in background mode and parses in real-time the output (stdErr) to report the current progress, at the end plays the converted video file, hopefully ;)
