  I didn't found a solution to the bug/problem, but perhaps the reason. The DX11CubeSimple is pretty much the same like the DX9CubeSimple beside the Geometry_Join-part. Perhaps the texture-coordinates are not correct... I haven't dived in the topic yet, and will do now. 
  
  But in the meantime, here is a better screenshot of the problem i have, if anyone wants to solve it (bigger version: <http://cl.ly/Pupg>).
