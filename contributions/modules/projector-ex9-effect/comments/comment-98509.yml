  ![projected texture doesnt show on mesh..](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/projected%20texture%20error00.jpg) 
  
  hi, i have a mesh exported from Mcneel Rhinoceros as a xfile.
  somehow i dont see the texture projected on the surface of the mesh although i see the projection planes... I am projecting basic parallel lines. Did the patch stop working after a certain build? 
  
  i checked the help file and tried the teapot and didnt see the texture projected either...
   
  i am using an alpha 29.3 build  btw..
  
  if it works and i would like to use it to write the video..that would be great...! the decompose node is connected to vector split with its xyz translate out. 
  
  what should I look at to isolate what my problem could be? thx...
