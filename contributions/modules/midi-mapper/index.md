add a module to flash your apc40 button like this picture http://i1336.photobucket.com/albums/o656/vjink/71fce071jw1e5s9w354rug205006otxx_zpse8833397.gif?t=1371541141


First to toggle "start MIDI Map" then bang/slider/knob your APC,you should see the IO box works

Copy and paste each modules to map different  midis

note that: You must toggle off "start MIDI Map" to work right
This module works on almost every MIDI controllers.

Enjoy.
