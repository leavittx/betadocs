  Is there a DX11 version somewhere?
  
  |edit| i've just manage to build a DX11 "dirty" solution by using MultiScreen (DX11) from (([dx11-modules-and-shaders-addition-ii)](xref:contribution/dx11-modules-and-shaders-addition-ii)))
   
  I hope I will have time to make it clean and release it one day. 
  
  |edit2| well after 2 hours trying to use my version, i had to consider using hard edges... my version is a nightmare to use
