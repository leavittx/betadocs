  Records any data to file with timestamps. Plays it back much like a filestream node.
  
  Originally developed to record infrared tracking data from the contour node and play it back later.
  
  The files it makes are sort-of human readable, for small data sets.
  
  It's not sexy and it's not perfect but it gets the job done. Use at your own risk.
  
  Issues
  - No passthrough when play is off, intentional behavior
  - Reverse speed not reliable
  - Files append. Recording a short file over an existing long file can cause weird behaviour
  - Opening large files can take a very long time
  - No record safe function, very easy to record over existing files
  - If you are playing when first recording you may have to rehit play
  - Probably has issues with maximum input length but I haven't run into them yet.
  - Bug where quotation marks in the string input screw things up.
