  @colorsound: I have not forgotten about you, been rather busy lately but this is high up on my TODO list. I am almost certain what you show in your post can already be achieved with the nodes as they are (maybe the the Add feature is needed for that). I will try to come up with a sample patch that shows this.
  
  @david: glad to hear it works for you! Indeed the Add pin is missing, right now it only adds on Change, but I understand this is not ideal in a lot of scenarios.  I will introduce that feature and an "Avoid Duplicates" feature in the next release.
  
  Cheers!
