  Great you are happy to update it. 
  
  -I think the more flexible the better so an autoupdate and manual seems good. 
  
  Other option is to have 2 versions the basic and the advance which have all specifi features, in case you only need to use the basic hundreds times for performance reason better to have basic and advance i,m just guessing.
