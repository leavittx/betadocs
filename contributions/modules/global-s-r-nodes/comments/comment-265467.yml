  @ravazquez , thank you for this contribution pretty useful. 
  
  i was looking and asking for something similar here https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/asset-checker-file/16304/2
  
  but in this case of the forum link the value should change and remain in same slice like normal s r nodes. so if i get a 0 it change to 0 and if i get a 1 it changes to 1 in same slice instead of adding a new slice in the spread. not sure if this behavior is posible too in your s r nodes ? 
  
  some more features requests ;D : 
  
  it seems now it adds values on a sort of internal onchange which is cool but a swith or something to add manually would be very helpful, could we add some manual add bang input pin for better control of it ? 
  
  and more powerfull and advance is to include an add and remove input pins choosing the slice input pin of the spread in which to add or remove. 
  
  great contrib ¡¡
