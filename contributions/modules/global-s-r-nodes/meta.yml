  This is a global S & R set of nodes which will allow users to send values from multiple locations in their application into a centralized "global variable" and receive all values in the same frame as a spread anywhere else on their application.
  
  Useful for example to store lists of values such as application-wide used fonts, configuration parameters, etc.
  
  For a working example check out \vvvv\girlpower inside the download zip.
  
  Cheers!
  
  ###  Features
  
  * Nodes come with support for Value, String, Color, Raw and Transform data types
  * Input spreads for all data types are supported
  * <span class="pin">Clear</span> pin allows resetting of the full value spread from any S or R node with the same <span class="pin">Name</span>
  * <span class="pin">Avoid Duplicates</span> pin prevents existing values from being sent
  * <span class="pin">Add</span> pin allow you to control when the data is sent
  
  The nodes work on both 32 and 64 bit systems.
