made this 3ds camera after the updated softimage camera came along.

i never really finished it but it does its thing.

catweasel reminded me about this thing with his c4d camera:
[camera-with-cinema4d-controls](xref:contribution/camera-with-cinema4d-controls)


feel free to pick apart and enhance - some suggestions in the help file!

not sure if i missed something - first contribution.
so let me know if it works...

also, sorry that you had to use the ZOP keys all along.

features:
-reset view
-store preset views
-wrap at click
-slow motion mode
