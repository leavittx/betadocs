  ####  AIIR (Animation).v4p - an Adaptive Infinite Impulse Response Filter
  
  simplified and short:
  .
  a IIR Filter with dynamic delay ratio.
  
  the delay ratio depends on the Input's Frame Velocity.
  
  means:
  small framedifference --> strong filtering
  large framediffence --> almost no filtering.
  
  this way 
  noise is filtered smoothly
  but peaks can pass almost unfiltered.
