  UVMap EX9.Texture Source outputs a texture suitable for texture coordinates editing.
  
  * it is based on colors, from red to magenta
  ** colors are differentiated by saturation OR value
  *** it is possible to invert saturation and value direction
  * outputs a texture for DX and OpenGL - the red (which is the first) quad will be either on the bottom left or on the top left
  * it is possible to superimpose text (0.0,0.1,0.2,...), change its color and font, and show brush
  * it is possible to choose UV map subdivision
  * ...
  Have a look at Inspektor, as usual.
