  This plugin loads the info from any <www.vioso.com> calibration software (vioso player, calibrator or Wings ) .vwf 
  
  Basically gets the 2 textures, one for warping and another for soft-edge blending.
  
  
  It really has a lot to improve... maybe someone with more experience can help... this is just a prototype, Im sure there's better ways to read the raw data.
  
  
  Since the warp texture is 128bit, for big .vwf files only works on x64
  
  The DX11ToDX9 texture is sending a 16bit texture.
  
  **Needs dx11 and VVVV x64**
  
  
  
  1.  ToDo:
  
  -Spreadable read of the raw data and display info
  
  -All ported to dx11
  
  -Add it to the VVVV-Dome maybe?
  
  
  
  
  
  1.  DOWNLOAD .vwf sample file HERE:
