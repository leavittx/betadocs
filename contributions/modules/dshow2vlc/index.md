Hi all.

This module would be a tool to help us all using other streams than the videos lurking in our HDs, and also to debug <span class="node">Filestream (Ex9.Texture VLC)</span>.

If everything is correct, the module can be useful to set a lot of params with a few clicks and/or digits, I suppose.

I simply browsed to this page: http://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help, had a look at MRL inside VLC, at <span class="node">Filestream (Ex9.Texture VLC)</span> helppatch and tried to translate all of those commandline params to something useful and simple to use in vvvv.

Hope is useful, and surely any feedback is more than appreciated.

Thank you all.

P.S. Helppatch included.
