  Hi @tonfilm, thanks for your comment.
  
  My initial idea was to do exactly what you describe, and this:
  
  ![](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/Untitled_4.png) 
  
  was my naive attempt to do just that, in my brain, the PathExists was only toggling once, but I can see that this is probably not how it actually works.
  
  What would be the right approach then? Only the path goes into the singleton and then only when the singleton changes read the XML?
  
  Cheers and thanks again!
