  This is a small contribution to set the 3d position for a given object. Found it a bit difficult sliding the values in the IO box so made a simple UI to move object in 3d space for ease and to have better sense of moving things.
  
  Perhaps this could be done using less nodes to make it more compact, feel free to edit.
  
  Cheers!
