  He Kalle, thats great!
   - i thought about something similar. how cool would it be to have a seperate window (or the nodebrowser) where you see a list of all patchlets and where you can rename, save & load (from / to clipboard) your patchlets. i think thats not hard to realize inside a plugin. if i have some time maybe we could talk about it..
