  This package adds nodes allowing you to use an Xbox 360 Controller in VL easily.
  
  Similar pin layout as this plugin for vvvv [xbox360controller](xref:contribution/xbox360controller) but adds a Is Connected output and also there are 3 versions of the node available:
  1. Standard - Outputs all controller inputs as either floats or booleans
  2. Vector - Standard with thumbsticks as Vector2 values
  3. State - Outputs a single Record object
  
  1. Install using nuget in the commandline:
  ```
  nuget install VL.IO.Xbox360Controller
  ```
  2. Add dependency to VL.IO.Xbox360Controller via the node browser
  3. Find nodes in IO.Xbox360Controller
  
  A demo patch is included in examples folder in the nuget install location
  
  Enjoy
