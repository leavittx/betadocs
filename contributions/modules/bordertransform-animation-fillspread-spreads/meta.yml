  This package includes 2 contributions:
  **BorderTransform (Animation)** generates border animations around incoming transforms with the following settings:
  - how many borders shall be generated *(1 to 4)*
  - the starting point *(top left, bottom left, ... )*
  - border length *(0 - 1)*
  - border width *(0 - 1)*
  
  **FillSpread (Spreads)** generates and fills spreads in dependence of the incoming input. One small example:
  Bin Size is 4
  Input = 0.0 -> SpreadOut = 0.0/0.0/0.0/0.0
  Input = 1.5 -> SpreadOut = 1.0/0.5/0.0/0.0
  Input = 4.0 -> SpreadOut = 1.0/1.0/1.0/1.0
  
  There are some more useful settings:
  - shift start & end points for each slice
  - set from & to values
  - set initial values 
  
  
  Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!
