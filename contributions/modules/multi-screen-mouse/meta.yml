  It's a pretty simple patch, but useful. If you use more than one screen, select the screen you want and the module will map your mouse coordinates to (-1;1) on that screen. Note that it will also map correctly if you have just one screen.
  
  Neighboring screens will be outside of (-1;1).
  
  (I was surprised to find that there was nothing like this available already.)
