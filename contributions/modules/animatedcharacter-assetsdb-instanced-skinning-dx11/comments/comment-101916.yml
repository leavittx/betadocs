  okey sorry for everyone who downloaded it and probably got confused.
  The joint namings were not assigned correctly to the incoming rotations from OpenNI. After using my FindIndexAssociaton which I created for these kind of database operations, it works now. 
  
  But still: this module doesn't solve the general orientation problem. It just makes it easy to use different models with different animation sources.
