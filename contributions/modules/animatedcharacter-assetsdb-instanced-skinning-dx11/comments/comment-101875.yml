  yes cool. building a motion database from the kinect tracking is the way to go.
  but to clear some confusion. 
  Ignore the BindSkeleton and the CustomSkeleton and the Strider for now.
  
  This is a developement tree I am not finished with: 
  In the custom skeleton there is a patch switcher that can load skeletons that were created in vvvv. In this case it loads a patched skeleton for a Half Life 2 Strider model that I found. It doesn't work so far, but this is another topic.
  
  for the Kinect mapping we look in version 0.3 I uploaded just a few minutes ago in the AnimatedCharacter->SkeletonAnimation->Animation->KinectJointMapping.
  
  cheerio
