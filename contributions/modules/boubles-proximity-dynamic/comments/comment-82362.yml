  Anyone know how I'd make a version of the proximity dynamic subpatch that worked in 3d?
  
  
  edit - looks like octrees are the way to go <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree>
  
  Am trying to make a 2d quadtree version first. Any hints welcome!
  
  (There are quadtree and octree plugins in the addonpack)
