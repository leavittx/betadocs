  This is an old patch i did studying **circles collision**. 
  I upload it for documentation and for educational reasons; if you are looking for proper 2d rigid bodies simulation have a look at Vux's Box2d plugins.
  
  Inside the patches you will find also the module **ProximityDynamic (2d Spreads)**. 
  This module is usefull when you have a large number of interacting agents: it's a grid based proximity detection that gives, for each agent-particle, only the indices of neighbour agents (this means optimization in interaction evaluation).
