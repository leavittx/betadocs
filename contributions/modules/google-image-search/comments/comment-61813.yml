  Nice result ... I friend of mine did a patch like that but as soon as google change the result page ( and they change pretty often ) your patch will break . Consider using some API, there are also Yahoo APIs for images .
  
  There is also a nice plugin by bo27 called Typewriter that can be useful for text input.
