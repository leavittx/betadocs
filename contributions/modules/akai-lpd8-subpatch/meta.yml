  A very simple basic subpatch working with the 4 preset files here enclosed. The preset files must be uploaded from the LPD8 Editor to the device.
  Only the midi channel is changing from one preset to another.
  CC and KeyNotes have same pitch IDs.
  
  Data is sended with S(value) so it is accessible in your patch from any R(Value) node.
