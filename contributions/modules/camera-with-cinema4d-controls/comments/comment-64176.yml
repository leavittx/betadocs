  Cool :)
  Thanks fibo, I always forget the ctl+m...
  but then don't often make modules as such, I tend to subpatch, and then reuse and alter a lot, so modules  would been I broke old patches with new, or have a million versions...
  I have a slight update to do, added a shift as well antokhio :) just after I'd posted this version, (see paragraph above...) but will add the control inputs too maybe...
