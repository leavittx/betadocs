  nice,
  
  consider to use the CTRL+M to edit author,description and tags ( now author = vvvv group since you started from the softimage Camera ) then add it to svn ( if you don't want to install tortoise svn I can do it for you under the catweasel folder ), so this useful module is included in the addonpack.
  
  You can still keep this contribution for development purpose.
