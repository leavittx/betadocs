  Nice on... it´s funny that i´m so used to the "1"/"2"/"3"-Key 
  kind of steering the camera in c4d that i didn´t even recognize 
  one could use alt and so on. :-) And i´m using c4d for ages now 
  (more than 15 years).
  
  Call me blind or dumb or call me ignorant, hehe.
  
  I guess i´ll do the alternative one day....
  
  Nevertheless. Good to see some guys bothering about the
  (in my opinion) not so perfect Camera(Softimage).
  
  Perhaps the whole thing could be transferred into a plugin...hmm..with assignable keys...hmmmmm... 
  
  Anyhow: Thanks, catweasel
