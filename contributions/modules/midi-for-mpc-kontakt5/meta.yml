  Receive/Send MIDI - Test with an Akai MPC Studio (MIDI Input and a Kontakt5 application (MIDI Output)
  
  MIDI INPUT: The input Midi data can be received from an Akai MPC where the Midi Out Port must be set for example to Loop
  MIDI PortB (Edit... Preferences..MIDI)
  
  The LoopMIDI is available at http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
  
  This software can be used to create virtual loopback MIDI
  ports to interconnect applications on Windows that want to
  open hardware-MIDI-ports for communication.
  
  MIDI OUTPUT: As the Kontakt5 VST Plugin does not work with vvvv VST plugin, you can here assigned the Midi Output Port to
  the virtual LoopMIDI PortA, and set the same one into the Input
  MIDI Options of Kontakt5 application. On this patch, the channel
  In must be (or not) the same as the channel Out.  
  
  That's all.
