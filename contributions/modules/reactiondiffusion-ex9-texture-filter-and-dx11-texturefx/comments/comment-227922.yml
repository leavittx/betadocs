  [matka](http://vvvv.org/users/matka), you can now download the file called "Reaction Diffusion DX11 - 3D Model Texture.zip" from the "other/older revisions" section in this same page.  It only works in DX11, at least for now.
  
  The ReactionDifussion node did not change.
  
  Credits for the shader go to [tonfilm](http://vvvv.org/users/tonfilm)
  
  Let me know how it goes.
