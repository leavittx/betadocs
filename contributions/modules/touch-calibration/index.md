Little GUI wrapping the homography node from openCV pack for calibrating multiple screens. I made this cause the included touch drivers often suck and only can be calibrated on a single monitor. 
Use the Touch Calibrator (Load) module to load the saved calibration matrix and put your touch input through. Other explanations included in the Patch. 

Feel free to modify and contribute back.

All Magic happening because of Elliot Woods great openCV pack, Thank you!

Requirements: image pack and table (included)
