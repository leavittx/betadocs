  Thats really helpfull, playing around with similar patches to manage different states of a game or a performance...
  
  i think it would be really helpfull to have 2 addidional bangs for...step forward or steb backward if you wanna sequentially sstep through the states in their order.
  
  a list of toggles as output that has the current state as on and the other as off would be also cool!
  
  again thx for sharing your work
