  Great suggestions [princemio](http://vvvv.org/users/princemio). 
  
  'CurrentState (State)' has been updated to have an "Idle State" list as well as the current "State".
  
  Two new modules have been added:
  
  1) 'Consecutive (State)' has two bang ioboxes for "Previous" and "Next" state. 
  
  2) 'StateList (State)' gives a complete list of states.
