Video Tutorial
<div class="box">
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7URBJLPl98&feature=youtu.be></div>
Simple and useful way to get the camera perspective from C4D software.
Very useful for facade projection mapping and to integrate vvvv with pregenerated content.
Full camera animation support with the help of xml.
Original 3d scene included for testing purposes.
to come:
Im starting to adapt the camera script, to the lights and vertex positions in geometry, to create  bidirectional framwork  between both applications in graphic production, any advice will be welcome.
