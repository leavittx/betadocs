  Modules / helpers for texture sharing between beta/DX11 and gamma/stride.
  Also contains helpers to match stride and beta cameras.
  
  Currently uses UDP for sharing the handles and camera matrix.
  Something like [VL.SharedMemory](https://github.com/cnisidis/VL.SharedMemory) might be better but I didn't want to add external dependencies.
