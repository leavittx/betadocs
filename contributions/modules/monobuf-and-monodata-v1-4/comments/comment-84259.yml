  Thanks for the comments!  They reminded me I hadn't posted the updated versions.
  
  However, I just found a bug with the "Life Time" pin if you change the value while things are still "alive", or spread it with dissimilar values; I've just been using it with a constant lifetime and didn't catch it until now.  Will fix and update ASAP.
