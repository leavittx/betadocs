  Advanced Stopwatch:
  
  I made this little patch as part of a bigger project, and thought others might be interested in it. It features play/pause, rewind, fast forward and stop/reset functions and raw seconds as well as split time output.

  Advanced Stopwatch:
  
  I made this little patch as part of a bigger project, and thought others might be interested in it.
  
  Functions:
  * Play/Pause
  * Fast Forward (double speed)
  * Fast Rewind (double speed)
  * Stop (resets the stopwatch)
  * Auto reset on 0 or given max time in seconds. max time needs to be set at something.
  
  The input go's through BANGS!! not TOGGLE'S.
  The output shows toggle's to indicate the active playback mode.
  The time output contains raw seconds, and the time split in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
