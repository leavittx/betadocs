  This is a volumetric light implementation I was able to create mainly from this great resource:
  http://www.alexandre-pestana.com/volumetric-lights/
  
  The module also contains a bilateral upsampling shader which allows for blending of lower res and high res renderings, using the depth buffer and soby eliminating pixelated edges. Also a bilateral blur which is edge preserving.
  
  Let it shine!
