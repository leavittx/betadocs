  Hi did you do the initiation resetting.  I think it could be also it took controllers in wrong order i need to change the transform from controllers from left right no general, otherwise the controllers transformation could have diferent index order each time you open the patch.  I need to fix that for next version
  .  As workaround close steamvr and inverse put controllers phisicly in left right. Then turn on again.
