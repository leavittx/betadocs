  If you don't have a numeric pad on your keyboard then typing alt-1, alt-2, alt-3 using the top numbers will change renderer view options when you are trying to type an umlaut.
  To prevent this with DX11 renderers use the 'Disable Shortcuts' option in the inspektor.
  For other renderer types you can use the 'shortcuts' node to disable all vvvv shortcuts.
