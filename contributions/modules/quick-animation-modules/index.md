Some simple modules i'v made for me to avoid remaking always the same structures to quickly animate things in vvvv for various reasons.

Fungen: to quickly create animation of values based on lfo and waveshaper with the possibility to set the number of loops and more.

Banger: to generate random values and bangs in a random or non random interval.

Gater: made to filter the input value under/below its tresholds with 2 different techniques and report if the input is under/below the tresholds.

Check out the help patches for a visual explanation

To install those modules copy the sapo folder from this zip to your vvvv/modules/ folder.

it's my first contrib.. be kind! ;)
