  This is my main mixer for Vjing. 
  
  Just add your content patch, be sure to have a Dx.Texture and a S node with the name of the content
  
  Select the content for layer 1,2,3 or control layer.
  
  It provides  3 Chanel mixer for 3 textures,
  The faders work as a blend or multiply depending on positive or negative values.
  
  2D transformation for each layer ( including control layer )
  control layer works as a  RGB mask, where R is Layer 1, G Layer 2, B Layer 3.
  
  This provides a quick way of doing complex compositions
  
  This is my first contribution, i hope you like it :)
