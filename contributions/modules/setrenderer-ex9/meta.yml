  SetRenderer (EX9) is a module that combines some SetPatch-operations to manipulate/force settings of Renderer (EX9) that are not available through normal pins.
  
  - set Componentmode of the Renderer(EX9) that normally only is available through keyboard shortcuts ( InAWindow <Alt+1>, InABox <Alt+2>, Hidden <Alt+3>, FullScreen <Alt+Enter> )
  - set size and position of a windowed Renderer(EX9)
  - switch off and on the border of a windowed Renderer(EX9)
  - set FullScreen dimensions and refresh rates for Renderer(EX9) (only works for resolutions "allowed" by EDID/graphicscard/windows)
  
  Although these kind of SetPatch actions generally should only be a "last option workaround", they might be useful from time to time.
