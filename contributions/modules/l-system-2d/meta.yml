  Let's create cool generative art.
  
  ##  How to use
  
  This L-System grammer is similar to lsys ( <http://benvan.co.uk/lsys/> ).
  ~np~
  F     : draw forwards by "size"
  + / - : rotate by +/-"angle"
  > / < : increase/decrease "size" by "DeltaSize"
  ) / ( : increase/decrease "angle" by "DeltaAngle"
  <%20/%20> : push / pop state
  1.      : negate "angle"
  
  |     : increment "angle" by 180(degree)
  ~/np~
  
  ##  Advice
  
  This is a beta version.
  When you write a deeply recursived expression, the behavior may be slow.
  I wanna increase the performance.
