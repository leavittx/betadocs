  Nice contribution! thanks! 
  
  Does it works with multislider? I only get the last value of a multislider. 
  
  You write "Set the OSC Addresses Spread according to what you use in your Lemur Project and always send as many values as you specified addresses." 
  I think that it's mean that multislider is not supported, am I right?
