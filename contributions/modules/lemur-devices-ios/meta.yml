  Two easy to use modules to use with the Lemur software on iOS devices. These modules can be used simultaneously, allowing bi-directional control. Both may easily be adapted for use with other OSC savvy soft-/hardware.
  
  Lemur Receiver (Devices) receives data by Lemur (iOS) from specified OSC Addresses. *Make sure to set the same port as specified in the Lemur iOS App (Settings > More settings > OSC Targets) or vice versa.*
  *Set the OSC Addresses Spread according to what you use in your Lemur Project.*
  
  Lemur Sender (Devices) sends data to Lemur (iOS) at specified OSC Addresses.
  Lemur IP = IP of your iDevice. Bear in mind that the port number of the iOS App is hardcoded to 8000 (so don't change it).
  *Set the OSC Addresses Spread according to what you use in your Lemur Project and always send as many values as you specified addresses.*
