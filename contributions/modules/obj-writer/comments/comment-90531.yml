  thanks catweasel!
  
  comes kind of overdue. i'm not too well versed with all this, but the .x file format seems strangely unsupported throughout most applications. supposedly too many different interpretations + licensing issues? panda for 3ds works great, but only for exporting. some older blender version seems to like the .x but not everybody likes the blender...
  
  one could go as far to say that there are hundreds of incompatible 3d containers that should all go ahead and rot in hell. but i won't go that far.
  
  how come the lonely vvvv deals with .x import and export since and for ever?
  
  saw this: http://web.t-online.hu/karpo/
  and now i'm scared. but still glad you made this!
