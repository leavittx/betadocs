  I've not tried using zeroMQ anywhere but in local host, I just tried to get it working to another pc, and I have issues with binding. 
  Opened help pathes for subscriber and publisher, on localhost all good, when I change the IP to the other PC the node goes red and I get 
  00:07:34 ERR : 
  vvvv.ZeroMQ: Enable of PublisherSocket failed. NetMQ threw an internal exception with tcp://192.168.178.21:4444
   Exception of type 'NetMQ.NetMQException' was thrown.
  
  00:07:34 ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate
  00:07:34 ERR : Exception of type 'NetMQ.NetMQException' was thrown.
  
  Changing the port doesnt help. Any ideas?
