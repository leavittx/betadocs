  interesting I never had that, obviously it's false alarm but I'll have a look on virustotal. In those DLL's I'm not doing anything "trojanish" afaik.
  Here are the sources btw https://github.com/microdee/mp.dx/tree/master/src/DX11Utils/DX11Utils.Native
  And the Virustotal report: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3f9d29617bf9e5de6c84cfad4f0646e9b1b63ca7de8127b18278bcec925c1ad4/detection
