  or how the Burmese would say သေးသည်အခြားသယံဇာတအထုပ်
  
  mp.dx (and including mp.essentials) is a big collection of convenience nodes solving a lot of common problems for vvvv.
  
  NOTE: while it is still useful, maintenance is sparse for this pack, I still fix bugs which found and can be dealt with easily.

  Rendering related nodes mostly for DX11 but there are some utilities for DX9 too
  
  <a href="vpms://raw.githubusercontent.com/vvvvpm/vpdb/master/microdee/mp.essentials/github.latest.vpack">mp.essentials</a>
  Essential lower level utility nodes for everyday patching
  
  While it is possible, manual installation is tedious and absolutely not supported. If there's a problem with VPM please report it in Github issues or in VPM's contribution page
