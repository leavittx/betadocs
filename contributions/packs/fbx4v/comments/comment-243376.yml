  Anybody made this works without headpain?
  First.. need to made vpm work,,,
  second need to install many packs i dont need..
  third...you finally open the patch..and doesnt works..
  four ...you get  a comercial popup,,that advise to dont use in any commercial project..
  i think is not nothing nice at all contribution cos it makes it depends of the logic of the creator.
  contributions should open doors to the other to contribute,,,
  not to work like others do.
  actually shouldnt be so difficult to import an fbx model ,,,
  it isnt in any "commercial software"
