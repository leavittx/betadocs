  Hey yar, sorry for the late reply,
  
  you can definitely operate on single particles by implementing your own Component.
  how you implement it depends on:
  * which condition you want to change direction (eg. they enter in a defined area, or you trigger the condition by particle index, ...). you need to define the rule.
  * how you want to change direction: by setting a new random velocity to the particle when the condition for that particle is true? by applying a force when the condition is true? ...
  
  Once you defined exactly how you want to operate you can create your component.
  you can copy an existing one (like the Brownian) and implement in there the logic for the condition and the behaviour
