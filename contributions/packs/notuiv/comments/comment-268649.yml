  I tried installing Notuiv as suggested via vpm but getting one red node though (which is <span class="node">Context (Notui)</span> ). The exception dialog tells me:

  I don't wanna spam the comments with stacks and loaded modules, so the full log is here:

  After a little bit of searchengining I might have an idea of what's going on, but really no idea of what to do about it.
  I installed and deleted 50beta37_x64 plus the whole vpm-Notui-routine several times and let ccleaner fix the registry in between, but things didn't change :(
