  Really good pack Motzi. Can you recommend somewhere I could go to understand the what is funamentally going on here so I could understand the application of my own [datasets](http://deeplearning.net/datasets)?
  
  The many of us who were not able to make your Workshop would probably like to understand what is going on a little better. Not that there is anything wrong with the GP patches, they're laid out very clearly, but novices like me need some dumb love.
