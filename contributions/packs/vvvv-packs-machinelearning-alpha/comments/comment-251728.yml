  hi @michaelsed,
  
  thanks for your kind words.
  to be honest i did not get the success i was hoping for when doing body gesture recognition but there is room for further research. so at the moment i do not have a good data set to demonstrate how they could be applied successfully.
  
  what do you have in mind to use it on?
