This is a first release of the MachineLearning pack, bringing several methods of the field to VVVV, mostly by wrapping functionality from the great [accord.net framework](http://accord-framework.net/) by CÃ©sar Souza.

<div class="box">
Note:
This is a first release which is still lacking most of the documentation and has not been heavily tested. 
</div>

There is some girlpower though.
Many of the features will be explained in the [upcoming workshop at NODE15](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/machine-learning-vvvv).

More detailed info to come...
