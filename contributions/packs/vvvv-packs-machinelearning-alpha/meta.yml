  This is a first release of the MachineLearning pack, bringing several methods of the field to VVVV, mostly by wrapping functionality from the great [accord.net framework](http://accord-framework.net/) by César Souza.

  Note:
  This is a first release which is still lacking most of the documentation and has not been heavily tested.

  There is some girlpower though.
  Many of the features will be explained in the [upcoming workshop at NODE15](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/machine-learning-vvvv).
