  ## Install
  
  Put next to dx11 pack in /packs directory so it looks like this:
   /packs/dx11
   /packs/dx11-Spout
  
  ## Use
  
  If it doesn't work for you try to reset (ALT+rightclick) the Spout (DX11.Texture Receiver) node. This is due to [fromsharedtexture-(dx11)-bug" "a problem with the FromSharedTexture (DX11.Texture 2d) node](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/fromsharedtexture-(dx11)-bug" "a problem with the FromSharedTexture (DX11.Texture 2d) node).
