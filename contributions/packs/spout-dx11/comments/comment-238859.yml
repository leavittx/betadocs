  Hello,
  
  I've been trying to link a texture from processing to VVVV with Spout. When I run the example it works well with the webcam, even it detect and read correctly my kinect v2. However, it doesnt't lists other two senders (Processing and SpoutSender) that I had already run as following the Spout User Manual. 
  
  Why I cannot receive info from other Spout sender?
  
  Thanks.
