  i use 24 spout senders with small texture sizes (128*128) and it's fine  
  Memory = 900MB
  GPU Load = 8% 
  Controler Load = 3% 
  
  with 24 x (1920*1200)  
  Memory = 1300MB
  GPU Load = 14% 
  Controler Load = 6% 
  
  should be nice to update the max count!
  
  regarding the pack of course the AsSharedTexture pointer update bug still need a fix
  the  only vvvvery dirty workaround i've found to update it is a deletenode + CtrlZ keystroke
