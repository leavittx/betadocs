  indeed there is the 10 entries limit. no good reason. just a compile-time constant, that (without thinking too much about it) i think just has to be set to a value, not too big, as it blocks memory.. so how many do you need, reasonably?
  
  regarding being included in the pack, see: https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv-girlpower/pull/45
