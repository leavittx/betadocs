  I also am seeing the send show up in the SpoutReceiver program, but when selected it is black.  This is with the Spout DX mode set to CPU.
  
  This is on an Intel GFX system, so SpoutReceiver will not work when mode is set to Texture GPU, complaining "Cannot create DX11/OpenGL interop" as soon as the vvvv source is selected, which the Spout docs say requires nVidia graphics.
  
  So it appears sending only works on nVidia - is that not the case?
