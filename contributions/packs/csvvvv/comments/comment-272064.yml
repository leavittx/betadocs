  Moin moin,
  
  @martontokes: Is it possible that you did not place the unzipped CSVvvv folder in your \packs folder?!
  
  
  
  @JoshClose: At first big thanks!
  
  I currently have the Problem that the links between the Reader an every other note are disconnected every time i relaunch vvvv and I have to reconnect them by hand. Is ther an way to improve or workaround? Thanks!
