  These nodes use the 2.1 and newer sdk of Leap with nearly all features it can have in an alternative approach to the current Leap implementation.
  
  Installation: put it in the packs folder
  Instructions: start girlpower.v4p
  
  new:
  - both for x86 and x64
  - now frames can be managed individually
  - which means you can retrieve earlier frames too
  - which also means you can serialize it
  - which again means you can save it to disc or send it over udp/tcp/sharedmemory/etc.
  - saving to disc part: now there's a Record/Player module pair
  - and finally: raw images! (which however doesn't get serialized :( )
