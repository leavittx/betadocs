  Problem between V4 and Leap (Device) VL.
  
  The computer is able to run the Unity Leap Motion Visualizer tool and on the control panel of the leap accessed from task bar everything is ok (green). 
  I took the last SDK Orion 4.0.0 But when I start Leap node in Vvvv nothing happened, the device say is not connected. 
  
  I already tried with several vvvv beta versions 35.8, 38.1 on x64 and 38.1 on x86 also the last alpha but nothing happened. I installed another computer because I had to and same problem.
  
  Also, when I start the Girlpower from leap back every single Leap node is red. I also copy the Vvvv.device.Leap.vl from alpha version to beta, but nothing changes.
  
  I don't see what to test now...
  
  Please
  
  Aurel
