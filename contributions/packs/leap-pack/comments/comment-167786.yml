  Great stuff!!
  just one thing,,, I can open the patch, works just fine... but only if i open the patch as the first patch of vvvv... if I put the example patch inside anotherproject, all nodes are red... If I drag the Dll inside the project, the nodes are listed, but they apear without any pin and in red...
