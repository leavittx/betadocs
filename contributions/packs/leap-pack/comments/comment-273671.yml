  The problem is about my new PC.
  
  Because on my laptop, Orion SDK 4.00 is working with Leap (Device) VL which I would like to use.
  But on the PC I tried with several version of V4 and several versions of Leap SDK V2, V3, V4, But even if The visualizer from Unity installed with Orion 4 is working and leap is connected, in V4 Is not connected.
  
  I will clone my SSD as last option I guess, or if you have something else.
  
  Thanks Microdee, but I never compiled github... sorry
