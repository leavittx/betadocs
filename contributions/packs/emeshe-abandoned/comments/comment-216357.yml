  Hey fellas :) 
  I have a question about Emeshe. It might be me or something but ... 
  Should we ditch the contrib version and go for the latest via GitHub and also should we go for 64bit instead of 32 bit ?
  
  I ask because I tried following the tutorials but half the nodes used there are non existent in the Contrib and mostly whatever I download is full of red or missing nodes ... 
  
  Please clarify as I am on the border of pulling my hair out :P
