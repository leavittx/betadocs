  @graphicuserinterface and @microdee:
  
  apparently its a small bug in the DX11 for 64bit release according to @vux. I didn't even realize there was an update for it. Just installed it and it runs without red nodes now using the latest update from 4th december 2013 :)
  
  It was really hard to find that DX11 contribution again btw. Tag filtering doesn't work at all when you search. Here is hoping for a better vvvv website one day..
  
  So here is the link again: [directx11-nodes-alpha](xref:contribution/directx11-nodes)
