  I think I am giving up on ever getting this to work. Tried everything suggested in the comments, but impossible to get it running. Such a shame as it looks awesome! Still red nodes everywhere.
  
  Just went through the prezi as well and it has everything I could ask for (especially ambient occlusion, dof and shadows).
  
  Is there really no way to get a working version of this somehow? Or do we have to wait for Emeshe 3 and hope its easier to run?
