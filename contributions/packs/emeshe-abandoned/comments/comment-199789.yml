  Hmmmm. I have problems with pretty much all the patches. They all look so strange. There are no red nodes, but... I don't think it's supposed to look like this?
  The name of the patch says "Box-Skulls-Shadows", but there are no shadows. And some of the other patches look horrible - all gray, only SSAO working...
