  by compile i meant opening dx11-vvvv.sln in visual studio (express) set target arcitectures to your desires (x86/x64, note: in x64 you have to copy the x64 slimdx dll's from dependencies to feraltic/dependencies) and press the build button, copy the resulting dll's to your packs folder (visual studio already does the packs\dx11\things folder structure for you)
  
  also can you enable Exception Dialogs ("ExceptionDialogs ON | OFF" in the bottom-right middle click menu) and if it throws an error in a simple scenario (so not in an entire project) can you copy that here?
