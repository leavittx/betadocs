  well, if you are using the latest modules from microdee and emeshe 2.2.1, dont even bother with girlpower because it is broken all over, i have a version of emeshe running that works but it took lots of tweaking and help from microdee, i can send you some basic patch that works for me, but i am also running quite a slimmer version without reflections etc., if you want to work with it, you have to be brave
