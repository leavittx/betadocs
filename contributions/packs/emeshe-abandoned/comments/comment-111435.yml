  Beautiful work. I'd really like to use this, but I'm getting a load of errors thrown in the TTY window, such as: "ERR : System.DivideByZeroException in VVVV.Utils: Attempted to divide by zero."
  
  Is this a bug, an installation problem, or none of the above? Happens in both beta31 and beta31.2...
