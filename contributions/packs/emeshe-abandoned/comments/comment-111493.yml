  yep that is the ugly framedelayed texture probably in DeferredBase or any other places i used it. until i won't upload an update just replace it with the official framedelay. or just disable exceptions. apparently i forgot to avoid a zero or a nil somewhere. you can dig it up in FrameDelay (DX11.Texture2D Ugly)
