  hi microdee,
  
  I followed the steps from your github page but there seems to be a problem with VObjects : all nodes are red and some don't even seem to exist anymore. I tried with both branches but I get nothing. 
  Saw you were working on VObject recently, should we wait for an update ?
  
  Thanks !
