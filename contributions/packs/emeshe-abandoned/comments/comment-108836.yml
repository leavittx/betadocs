  Autofocus texture out seems to no want to connect to anything for me, ATI
  Also in the MRE subpatch it looks like its still using 7 slices, is that right?
  Been trying to get particles working in the MRE environment, but I haven't figured it out yet, I get lots of meshes, but they distort the models somehow, any clues?
