  hi! i am experimenting with mrmod (point light scene in particular), and i have few questions,
  
  1. what is this SSAO artefact, i was tweaking all the options, did not found anything that affects it, that white rim on the left side

  2. the shape of point lights is tied to aspect ratio of render, i was trying to fix it but if i fix the aspect ratio of the light it will break aspec ratios of geometry

  ![circle](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/a.PNG) 
  
  you can see on the first image that the light shape is oval, not circle
  
  3. is it possible to work with transparency in mmrmod? to have objects dissapear with fading SSAO effect (i am building interface so i want to have possibility to work with transparency)
  
  thanks!
