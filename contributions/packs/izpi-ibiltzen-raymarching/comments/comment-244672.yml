  this system can make nice use in realtime as Pedro has shown at that mapping this summer
  if you plan to work the contrib further in vvvv context, i suggest a modular approach like this:
  
  node for formula input, maybe presets for basics, something like TransformIn for move around
  node for boolean operation, two inputs and operation
  node for ray emission, all your params in there
  node for ray modifier, probably with formula input.. 
  node for displacement with texture input
  ToGeometry node
  
  hope this makes sens
  
  anyway keep up the good work bro bro
