"And on the eighth day, God said to Nacho the Basque: I will throw you the rays of wisdom and ye shall bring back a bunch of colourful pixels, and a cold beer from Belgium."
Don't be fucking confused Nacho, I got yer, broh broh, meet "Izpi Ibiltzen" the ultimate and simple as fuck solution for raymarching in vvvv.
"But to do raymarching, you need a solid raymarcher, you know, lighting ain't easy, is it broh? and what about depth or fog, I mean I am more into Motorsports and the closest I ever was to being "nautical" is when I went fishing with my dad that one time he was sober"
WORRY NOT, Nacho, you old bean, take a pew and relax your chin. Izpi Iblitzen does all this crap for you and you just concentrate on "drawing your shit" and "colouring your shit", the rest is done by pressing some toggles. There, there homie, it gon' be alright.

THIS IS A PACK, PLEASE INSTALL AS A PACK, DON'T BE A PRICK ABOUT IT.
Unzip the file in the "packs" subfolder inside your version of vvvv
So you should end up with something like this: "C:\vvvv_50beta37_x64\packs\IzpiIbiltzen"

LOOK IN THE GIRLPOWER FOLDER FOR LOADS OF EXAMPLES. (17 to be more precise, broh)

This pack is made in major parts from code written by Inigo Quilez on shadertoy and in his articles, which I have converted and adapted to vvvv using more code from UNC and some of my not so magical magic. So, major thankx go to Inigo Quilez and UNC and well fuck it, I will give myself a pat on the back as well broh.

Special thankx go to: Kyle McLean (everyoneishappy), Christian Loclair (princeMio) and Marta Soto (otosatram).

Warm thankx go to my demoscene group DESiRE and especially RamonB5 and VIRGILL from ALCATRAZ. Thankx to MERCURY demoscene group for their SDF library. Also thankx to some guys on shadertoy, namely: Shane, emh, XOR, 2v_S, huwb and obviously Dave Hoskins, christ, you da man.

YES this is THE PACK for THE "Raymarching amongst shit jokes" workshop at Node 2017, you're in the right place.

IF IT BECOMES ALL WHITE IT'S BECAUSE YOU GONE INSIDE THE GEOMETRY, MAKE GEOMETRY HOLLOW OR UNCOMMENT THE LINE IN SHADER TO MAKE YOUR CAMERA HOLLOW OUT THE GEOMETRY WHEN IT TOUCHES IT.

Have fun, you crazy brohs.
