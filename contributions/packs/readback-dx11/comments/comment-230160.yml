  @lassemunk @sunep
  thanks for figuring out about pack location!
  
  i noticed that vux's latest release is missing DirectXTex
  so that's why I added it to my zip, but i needed to put those dll's into the dx11 folder location in order for them to work
  hence you need to unzip this pack at vvvv.exe so that everything lands correctly
  
  @lassemunk - concerning R16_UNorm saving (e.g. depth map)
  AFAIK, this should be supported correctly so i'm sad to hear it's broken
  
  i'm sorry but i don't have time to look into this right now
  
  the source is available at:

  in case you want to (know somebody to) have a go at fixing it.
  otherwise please can you add an issue there
