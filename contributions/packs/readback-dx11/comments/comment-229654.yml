  Hi Elliot, 
  
  I would like to try out the Readback nodes, but I get an error that 'DirectXTexLib_x64' is not found. 
  
  I've searched around and found the library 
  
  https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex
  
  but I am new to github, and not sure how to install this library. The library states that it is made for Visual Studio 2015 update 3, so I've downloaded / installed VS2015, but I don't get how I can use it to install the DirectXTex library. 
  
  If this is in fact necessary, could you then include the correct git command line in the description for this pack? I think it would be very helpful for others too in the future :)
  
  Thanks a lot ! 
  
  Lasse
  
  
  EDIT (with help from sunep):
  
  I found out that I had misunderstood the way I was supposed to install the pack. 
  
  The correct way is to install 7zip unzipper software, place the .zip folder of the ReadBack package next to the vvvv.exe, right click and press 'Extract here'.
  
  7zip will hereby place the content of ReadBack to the correct subdirectories of the allready existing packs folder. 
  
  I had forgotten to copy the content of DX11 (the DirectXTex_64.dll) to the already existing DX11 folder, because I thought this was just a DX11 library for vvvv.
  
  Thanks to Sune!
