  @sebl really like this pack! Are there any dependencies i need to install? 
  
  Its working perfectly fine on my 38.1 Installation but not on a different pc with the exact same vvvv. So i guess its not the VVVV installation. The regualar DX11 2d writer is working, but still it might be some Windows User-Rights issues?
