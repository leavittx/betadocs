  @guest: as we're doing our first proper work with d.o.p.e. now I also experienced what you are describing and the problem seems to be auto layout in combination with the constant shader- the geometry composed in the IndexedGeometryBufferTriangleList subpatch has normals in it, also vertices are float3 and texcoords float2, but the constant shader does not use normals (which doesn't matter i suppose) and expects float4 for vertices and texcoords- as I understood the auto layout pin on the geometry shader is there to fix this, but it doesn't seem to work all the time. 
  So to fix it permanently, either make your own copy of a constant shader and change the layout in there, or change the IndexedGeometryBufferTriangleList subpatch to match the layout of the shader you use!
  
  I will include an alternative version of IndexedGeometryBufferTriangleList inthe next release!
