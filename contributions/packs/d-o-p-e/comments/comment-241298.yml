  Hi guest,
  
  to be completely honest I've been super busy doing other stuff since I've released dope, so there wasn't time to test/debug it a lot. However, while doing all the help patches I have never experienced what you are describing.
  Can you isolate the problem and share that patch?
  
  Also: you can check if the matrix produced by BoundedBiharmonicWeights makes sense by summing up its components (+ spectral on output pin)....this should (almost) match the number of vertices you pass to the BoundedBiharmonicWeights node (+-5%), plus this should come to the same result every time!
  
  I didn't do tesselation +dope yet, but also I don't see how this would affect results, should work fine I suppose, please share a patch if you can!
