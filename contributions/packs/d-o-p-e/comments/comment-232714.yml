  THX for this amazing Contribution and for the nice vveekend vvorkshop with microdee :-)
  
  Question
  Triangle Pin(Segments, Unity) and BoundedBiharmonicWeights 
  I have some issues with Bones and my Octopus
  I got that I need to "Unity" the "Triangle" that "BoundedBiharmonicWeights" can do it'S magic but my Mesh looks weird. When I have more than 4Bones my Mesh get's crazy with Segments and Unity - if I switch of Segments it's ok but bones connect everything.

  I can fake it with Alpha but what I didn't get here?
