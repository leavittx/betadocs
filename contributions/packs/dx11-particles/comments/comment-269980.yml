  Hi, here the files used <https://we.tl/t-WOV2VuMbBN>
  
  I just added those lines, cos i needed to use this "mechanic" withouth selections (i gave it a fast try, was gettin to complex in order to color something faded and properly).
  
  I understand what you mean with selection logic, maybe there could be a variant using binsize in a different way, but I don't have the package vision, that's why i asked "if it makes sense " :)
  
  
  Thank you for help and support
