  bur why does it not affect their lifespan?
  
  the way i would expect age and lifespan modifiers work:
  
  if i have particle of lifespan of 1 and i set the age to 0.8 on every frame, they should never die
  if i have particle of lifespan of 1 and set lifespan to 10, it should live 10 times longer
  
  right now if i set the age modifier to 0.8, the particles with lifespan of 1 still get emitted every second
  and if i set lifespan to 1, particle never dies
