  Thank you for nice contributions and reaaallly appreciate help patchs :)
  Is there a way to obtain a copy of a kinect emitter partciles that can be modified, let's say to produce a continuos trail ?
  
  Actually from the helppatch is applied a Z force, it looks like it reset positions moving all particles away, without replaving them, how does it works ? 
  
  Thank you in advance.
