  Hi,
  I got a problem figuring out the kinect calibration (calibration(dx11.particles.kinect)help.v4p). I'm trying to calibrate on a xy-plane, but since the PickPoints are on xz-axis the calibration turns out wrong. I didn't find a way to rotate the PickPoints before calibration (which worked in pointcloud if I remember correctly). Is there any way to do this?
  
  cheers
