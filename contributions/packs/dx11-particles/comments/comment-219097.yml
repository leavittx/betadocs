  Hello velcrome and much thanks for the information. 
  
  I have some additional questions for this:
  
  Do I need this one for merging in realtime? Would it be possible to record the data separately an merge it afterwards?
  
  What else do I need.. or could you briefly give kind of workflow? 
  
  
  Sorry for the beginners questions... I really don't know where to start.
  
  
  Best regards
