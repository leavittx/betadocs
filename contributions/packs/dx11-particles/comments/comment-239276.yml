  This screenshot illustrates the grid emission when setting the Mod input to 39. Guess every 39th pixel of the Kinect texture is used for emission. Iâ€™m wondering if there is a way to achieve a more irregular emission. For example emitting from every point, but rather than at every frame all together, in random intervals for each point. That would already cause a more natural distribution without too much load.
