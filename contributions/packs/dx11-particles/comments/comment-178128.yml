  Hello,
  
  I need some help. I want to calibrate kinect with a projector so i use the "calibration (kinect setup)help.v4p".
  
  I follow the steps and everything seems to go fine. My problem is that i can't understand how i can apply the trasnformation on the joints positions of the "skeleton". I tried to use "applyTrasform" and inserted thw joints positions and the "transform out" from the "calibration" node, but it didn't work. Could someone help me?
  
  Thanks in advance.
