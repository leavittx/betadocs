  @tmp - ooops, missed that.  Easily done using the dynamic modifiers!
  
  
  Btw - awesome contribution :)
  
  
  
  Also -   What's the best way to draw splines following a particle's path?  I'm currently trying - 
  
  - attribute buffer (position out)  >  verlet (3d buffer)  >  spline buffered 
  
  but it's not quite right. Also I don't know how to set the spline count to only the number of alive particles..
