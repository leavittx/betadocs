  Guys, you really have to check out the forces-part of the pack. Is already a lot of fun and contributing of additional stuff highly appreciated. We have the next implementations on the list (verlet + constraints, boids, connectall, sorting, etc.). But if you have already something on your hard-drive, feel free to implement it in the pack and make a pull request. Lets build a(nother) powerful particle-libary!
  
  Ah, and don't miss the MultiEmitterWithGroupedForces.v4p-girlpower patch. Eventbased behaviour-switching!
