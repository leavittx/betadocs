  thx for your fast reply! i am pretty sure, that i installed the proper architecture. girlpower does not work exept asymp geometry, but without colourfade. plugins work. modules all show the same symptoms. io boxes (string) need a long time to display content. then renderer goes black fullscreen for a second then. tty goes wild. system msg: nvidia driver disabled.
  basically all the dynamic buffers make troubles. can do more analysis later. will post in issues. allthebest.
