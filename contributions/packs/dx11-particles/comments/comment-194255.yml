  1.  UPDATE
  
  changes in the latest version (08.05.15):
  * introduced a separate node for kinect 2 that uses the kinect2 raytable to calculate world coordinates (instead of fov for kinect1).
  * the texture-based building of pointclouds (kinect1/2 & layer) is a bit faster now (uses numthreads 8,8,1 instead of 64,1,1)
  
  
  @cunk111: i dont't know contributions of evvvvil or everyoneishappy that are related to pointclouds. so i cannot say anything to performance.
