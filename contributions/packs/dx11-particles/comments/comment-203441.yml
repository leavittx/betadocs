  1.  UPDATE
  
  ##  NEW
  
  * added forces pack (have a look at girlpower/forceExamples/ and help patches!)
  * camera node has enabled pin and better default values
  * better namings for visualization nodes (Constant, Sprite, Mesh)
  * bang on success in calibration
  * pointsmoothing is a separate module now and gives better results by using an advanced queue (was included in calibration module before)
  * reader and writer for transforms (very useful to save/load calibrationdata)
  * analysis nodes additionally output their data as buffers (so you can avoid expensive readbacks)
  * added alot of enabled pins
  * no distinction between PointcloudBuffer for Kinect1 and 2 anymore -> one node for both
  * pointcloudbuffer can use raw images now (faster - kinect2 only)
  
  ##  FIXES
  
  * fixed alot of issues with nil inputs for group ids
  * fixed framedrops triggered by kinect2 node
  * fixed oversampling bug for pointcloudbuffer node
  
  There are some features that need the latest build of dx11!
  For those of you that are not able to build it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51232449/dx11_x86_x64_2015-08.zip
  
  Have fun! Feedback appreciated! ;)
