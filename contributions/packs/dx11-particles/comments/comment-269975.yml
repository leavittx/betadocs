  It means its' mandatory to use selection in order to use colors binsize ?
  
  In my test, i'm not using any selection and behaviour, in a way, it's not correct, as you can see i'm passing colors spreaded, but everything is only using the first bin.
  If, I use the selection it works, but I don't need any selection :)
  
  What i'm asking is if colors can be managed directly from CBD shader,as i was expecting to work.
  Another solution I can apply, is to have a lerp inside shader loop and so manage a fadeToBlack with another incoming float buffer, not elegant but working perfectly.
