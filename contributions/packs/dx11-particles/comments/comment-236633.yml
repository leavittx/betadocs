  I'm having trouble using custom resource semantics (with a 3d buffer)
  
  Render semantics seem fine
  
  Patch here https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl3wgw5axhp119u/Vortex.zip?dl=1
  
  (look in psys Vortex - nothing is happening when addressing the 3d buffer values and applying them to the force variable)
