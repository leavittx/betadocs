  Hi guest,
  
  "Could it be possible that multiple particles emitting from the same point and thus things getting slow?"
  
  -> Check the "Emit Count Per Particle" pin @ Emitter RWStructuredBuffer node. It should be set to 1.
  
  "Maybe there is a way to restrict the emission my using filters on the Kinect textures?"
  
  -> You can do that by decreasing the resolution @ Emitter Kinect node.
