  reaktant this is an interesting point and indeed a good idea. there are for example alot of good helper modules (f.e. operandomatic,grid,...) that would be nice to have in a pack. 
  
  noir thanks for this hint. i created the projector(dx11) node some weeks ago and it is part of the dx11-girlpower package. (see https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv-girlpower) 
  unfortunately the latest vvvv-dx11 zip file is not up to date so all you have to do is replace the existing girlpower folder with the one you can download on github.
