  Nice work, Luper. I love the wired canvas :)
  
  Would you mind adding some attribution to the documentation of your project to the benefit of intolight and tmp's work? It has been quite an investment of time and work to get the pointcloud pack to where it is now, hence the creative common license obligation of 
  
  * Attribution
  * Non-Commercial
  * Share-Alike
  
  I can see that this wasn't a project for the big bucks but for the arts, and we also appreciate you giving away the cellular shader as an appreciation in kind, so this might not apply to you at all, but for completeness:
  If you want to earn money with it, don't want to mention our name in the context of your installation or give someone parts of the code under different licensing terms, just get into contact with us. 
  Easy, we don't bite. We just feel it unfair if someone takes the cake we baked without us having a share.
