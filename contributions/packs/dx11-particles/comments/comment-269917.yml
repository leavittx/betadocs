  Hi all, is there any way to have multiple target for ScaleByDistance and/ or ColorByDistance ?
  How to modify particle system "areas" by several vectors ? I was thinking about selection, but anyway cant have, in example, a smooth color transition since select is boolean.
  
  Thank you in advance
