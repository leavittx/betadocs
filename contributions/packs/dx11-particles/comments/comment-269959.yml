  About ColorByDistance, can get working colors properly,let's say I have 4 positions, and 5 color for each of them, actuallty can't get it working properly in order to manage colorsets separately, did u try that ? Guess ColorBuffer should be indexed within loop.
  
  p.s.: In ColorByDistance help patch binsize pin is set to 13.
