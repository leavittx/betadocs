  **Question / Bugreport:**
  
  Emitter (DX11.Particles.Emitter RWStructuredBuffer) Help-Patch:
  
  Why is first Emitter (EmitterDynBuffer1) affected by the "Force" connected to the "Selection" on the right? Seems the selection is not working properly. Would assume that only the Emitter RWStructuredBuffer-Particles are affected by that.
