"A grandiose, elegant and GPU accelerated ray casting collision detection for vvvv DX11." - Pedro Van Tortillas

Microdevil Intersect will solve all your collision detection problems and provide your family with the right amount of offensive laughter in the warm comfort of your own home (unless you live with Pedro in his cold and bleak sex-dungeon-stroke-crystal-meth-lab).
I can already hear some of you cheer and tap your feet in anticipation and trepidation at the joy of building all these penis-based ray casting apps... Fear not my friend, the truth about ray casting has finally landed in your humble abode, and, for once, the truth is more than half a sausage.

This tool has been officially certified by Pedro Van Tortillas, therefore any bug report will be ignored, unless it is delivered by a goat sailing a boat.

Merry fucking Christmas and happy fucking new year. evvvvil

INSTALLATION: To install just place the unzipped "Microdevil_Intersect" folder in /packs folder.

Special Thankx to UBERACT and SUPERBIEN who supported the development of this tool.
