  Hey @Tonfilm I'm trying to wrap my head around another aspect of the DynamicUI example.
  
  The DynamicUI example uses a lot of delegates, but I'm having trouble putting any of the craftLie primitives into delegates as I get 'A process can only be used in a stateful patch' errors. How did you do it?
