  (edit)
  ;) I am sorry for the flood 
  
  so after restart, installing 28alpha and the rest,
  same problem like in the beginning with 27.2,
  28alpha reports:

  NOTE: I found a **bug in error reporting** inside the ContextAndImages node,
  here possible fix:

  Elliot, are you sure that your OpenNI works with XtionPro, 320x240@60fps or is hardcoded 640x480@30 and so on kinect-wise stufish?
  
  Thanks
  
  cheers
