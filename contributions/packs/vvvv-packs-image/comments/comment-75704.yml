  the initiative i intially had with these nodes is to set a new standard for an 'image output' in vvvv. indeed, to get it into the addon pack and make it exactly what you're talking about.
  
  Also you should only need to link against VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV as that gives you interfaces to deal with the image data. Also that means I can switch out EmguCV later and nodes that are written against VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV will still work. I've done a little bit of updating to the way generators work in the recent release.
  
  Is there anywhere I can look at your source / co-contribute to the vlc plugin (perhaps help you clean out any unnecessary EmguCV)
