  thank you @[everyoneishappy](http://vvvv.org/users/everyoneishappy)!
  You made me happy with your shader.. Anyway the code editor gives me an error, but is working like a charm..
  
  So, go to Elliot gitub and compile the last VVVV.Packs.Images
  The patch "Decode (Image.StructuredLight) help" in nodes\plugins should look like this (somewhat):
  
  ![](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/Decode%20%28Image.StructuredLight%29%20help_2013.10.10-19.22.57_0.png) 
  
  Then use AsTexture (OpenCV DX11 bla bla) to plug into your shader.
  It works.
  
  As someone on the forum sayd, EliotWoods will release the new contribution soon.
  So stay tuned. I'm going to fund him.. ..He also bought the licence for EmguCV, so..
  
  I added you on skype.
  Bye!
