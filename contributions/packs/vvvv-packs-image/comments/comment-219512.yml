  So i managed somehow to recompile it for x64. 
  Things that i was able to test are working but there might be broken nodes here and there. 
  I need it for now mostly to read HDR images as i am playing a bit with Emeshe.
  
  On my first test when it is installed in /packs/ it kind of broke the Assimp modules, but after some adjustments seems to be OK.
  
  Best regards!

  BTW please if i am braking any license rules please contact me and so i can remove it.
