  hi Elliot,
  just few notes on the opencv nodes
  regarding the videoin (OpenCV) & videoin (OpenCV directshow)
  in some case you need to specify the native resolution of your cam
  for example my ids GigE cam only works @ its full resolution 1024x768
  with a cheapo webcam all resolutions are supported
  tested under beta 27.2 & 28.
