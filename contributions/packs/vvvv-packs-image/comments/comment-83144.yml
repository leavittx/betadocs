  @DiMiX - maybe i can make a demo vid of this working with a fresh copy of vvvv beta
  Please try to  put it in something like vvvv45beta27.2/VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV
  And add it to your search path in vvvv's root patch. (maybe there's a good demo of how to do that somewhere?)
  Alt+r to show root patch
  
  I was getting some red nodes in some modules due to the v4p's storing relative paths
  To fix this just double click the red nodes and select the right plugin
  
  Can you post a screenshot of what's red
  
  @liquid : interesting, not getting that issue here.
  Low fps is only for that VideoIn node for you?
  
  Cheers for feedback!
  
  Elliot
