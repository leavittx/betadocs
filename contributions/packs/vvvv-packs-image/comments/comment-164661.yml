  Apologies about the nvcuda.dll issues!
  I had noticed this last month also, I wish I'd made a note somewhere at the time.
  
  Some notes at:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12594993/emgucv-nvcuda-dll-could-not-be-found
  
  (including my download link for the file incase another one is down).
  
  Might drop all CUDA support from image pack and go with non GPU flavour until Emgu goes 2.4.9, or we go for another OpenCV wrapper (without EmguCV).
  
  Elliot
