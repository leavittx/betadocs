  @elliot,besides the low fps,i also noticed seems that the videoInput(DirectShow) node can't shut down properly even though i deleted the node,the camera indicator light still remains. i'm using beta27.2,btw my webcam only working with YUY2 colorspace. but working fine with your older opencv version.
  
  cheers!
