  hey Elliot
  thanks for those threading explanations
  make sense now!
  
  just a question about what could be integrated in the emguCV 
  hierro talk about a Crop node, it could be cool to have some more transform nodes like homography/distortion (like in the camera calibration but with user input values?) before the AsTexture/mainloop
  what do you think?
