  Hi Elliot,
  
  I'm testing the Video-In CV node extensively with both Optical Flow nodes.
  (To drive the Dottore's GPU Particle)
  
  I'm using the Ps3eye and I need to access the property of the camera (turn off auto-exposure, setting the gain, etc..).
  
  I tried to do it in the Ps3eye Cleye-Test but the videoIn CV node reset the setting to defaults..
  
  Is there any workaround?
  Thanks
  
  PS: These NEW Node type are very performant and revolutionary in VVVV.
  With Vlc (or some videoplayer) included, we have a new world to explore at 60fps.
  
  Keep up this good work.
  
  PPS:I'm on beta26 because I want to use Your CV stuff.
  
  Cheers
  robe
