  there's an help patch in packs\Images\nodes\plugins called Decode (Image.StructuredLight) help.v4p. Using the new build from <https://github.com/elliotwoods/VVVV.Packs.Image> after relinking some red node I'm able to see how it works and it exactly output the UV pass of the scanned area.
  
  My question is is there a DX11 shader that accepts 2 texture doing the UV map?
  1 Source texture to be mapped according to the UVpass of the 2nd.
  
  Also is there a way to accellerate this process?
  
  Anyway this contribution rocks!
  thanks Elliot!
