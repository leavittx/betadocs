  @elliot
  could you shade some lights on the timestamp pin (videoin node)?
  
  @robe:
  yep the show settings and capture property  depends on your hardware
  in the current release it's for standard webcams
  for specific cams like ps3eye or ids uEye an Enum list in the captureProperty node could do the job!
