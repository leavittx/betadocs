  @mrboni I built myself a 64bit version, and had to jump through some hoops to do it.
  So a lot of nodes in this build are probably broken, I know the video-in nodes don't show up. But all the basic CV nodes seem to be okay (Homography, CalibrateProjector/-Camera, Features, etc.)
  
  Use with caution:

  (this does include a 64bit nvcuda.dll I dug up from the net, of dubious origin. but we run all sorts of dubious dlls anyway, no? ;))
