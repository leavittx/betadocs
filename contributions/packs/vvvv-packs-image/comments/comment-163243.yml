  I continue my troubleshooting log here
  
  Note it is not anymore about getting the PS3 Eye to work but about fixing an error that I get on a lot of Nodes as output of the Status pin.
  
  Appearently some users report it does not work on ATI cards.
  
  But that is not the issue that causes that error:
  'The type initializer for 'Emgu.CV.CvInvoke' threw an exception.'
  
  The error appears as output on for exampe FileImage or the VideoIn (CL Eye).
  
  I tested it also a lot on a 32bit W7 system with an intel HD4400 chip and it didn't work, same error.
  
  The interesting thing is that it works on my personal notebook with exactely the same software and similar hardware
  beta32.1_x86 with the imagepack from this page
  intel hd4000
  and this is a 64bit W7
  
  I realy don't see what could be the difference between the systems that can cause that error.
  
  If you have any idea, they are very welcome! 
  
  Edit:
  
  The solution was found it was an missing dll

  Edit2:
  
  You can download the missing dll here 
  http://www.symbioticcube.com/Downloads/nvcuda.dll
  
  put it in nodes/plugins/dependencies/opencv/x86/
  
  It should also fix anything that was previously accoutned to ATI cards.
  Thanks to alg for that essential hint.
