  that's the Emgu CV .net DLL's which should be in the package
  
  this error is caused by either:
  * they're not in the right place
  * the dll's have strange security settings which can be caused whilst unzipping
  
  please see the note at the top of this page about 'ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate: Could not load file'
  it's difficult to read in Internet Explorer.
  
  essentially you need to make sure you DO NOT drag and drop the dll's out of the zip file, but instead use Extract all... (or just use 7zip)
