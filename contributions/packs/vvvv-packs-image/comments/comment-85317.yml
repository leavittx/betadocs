  To confirm the user texture info - the texture is a single 16bit channel. So if dealing with the texture in a shader, the colour value of user 1 is 1/65535, user 2 is 2/65535 etc.
  
  You can use this to map each user's pixels to a different visible colour if you need, like the native openni user node does.
  
  If just using the cvimage, = (opencv) will take just the integer value of the user id. easy!
