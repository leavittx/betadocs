  Ciao Elliot,
  
  I tried both, the one without Property is useless beacuse I've to access the exposure and gain (It's a IR-modified Ps3eye), the other node let me open the Capture Property but the checkers and the slider are grayed out and not clickable.
  
  Just waiting for the custom node, but with no hurry, I'm fighting with kinect for now...
  
  Instead I pray for a B27.1 compatible version for your OpenNI-CV Stuff:
  
  *OpenNI 1.5.2.23 (32bit, stable, redist edition)
  *NITE 1.5.2.21 (32bit, stable, redist edition)
  *SensorKinect091 5.1.0.25 (32bit)
  
  (Copied from the OpenNI Contribution but that thread was considered closed by Joreg, so I don't know what was embedded in B27.1, *Here this package works* and I'm happy -OFF TOPIC-)
  
  Even though I'm thinking to downgrade to B26 for your amazing calibrate kinected projector...
  
  Thanks Elliot I really believe this OpenCV stuff is a great alternative to FreeFrame, but also for some Texture Filter in terms of performance..
  .. Correct me if I'm wrong..
  
  Keep up good work! Your GitHub would be a gold mine if I was a real programmer..
  
  Bye Bye
