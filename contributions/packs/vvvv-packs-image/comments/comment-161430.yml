  hi
  get an half working  x64 image pack for beta 32.1
  it was really painful to replace all the references cause the nuget thing doesn't work as excepted or i mess it up!
  
  please correct me if i'm wrong,
  but some nodes are x86 only due to their dependencies:
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.DeckLink.dll (x64 sounds possible)
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.OpenNI.dll (no x64 at all and probably depreciated?)
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.VideoInput.dll => VideoInputSharp.dll (x86 only !!)
  the Videoin (Cv.Image Directshow)doesn't work but vfw one works!
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.Table.dll (apparently moved to addonpack but not yet available)
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.FlyCapture.dll (x86 only?)
  
  -VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.OptiTrack.dll (should work but...)
  00:37:13  *  : Type 'VVVV.Nodes.OptiTrack.VideoInNode' not found in assembly 'VVVV.Nodes.OpenCV.OptiTrack, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. Failed to create plugin node VideoIn (OptiTrack) (ID: 44).
  
  all the other nodes of the Image Pack works for me...
  @elliot is there any plan for a x64 release?
