  thxs for the update. just did testing with 27.2&alpha 28
  ok,the videoInput(DirectShow)seems now working just fine with my beta27.2,got normal 30 fps(how come the older one up to 60?),however the VideoIn (OpenCV) still not working with both27.2&alpha28,no given images at all.
  
  VideoIn(CLEye) perfectly running up to 60fps on both version.
  with alpha28 the videoInput can shutdown properly,beta27.2 still the same.
  cheers!
