  Hi Elliot, what i  tried is this  :
  
  Connect the Kinect texture to the ImageResize and change width/height values fastly, I was prototyping a crop node to catch hands ROI: randomly the resulting texture is black, just for a frame.
  I also tried different methods for resize function and passed only width/height values divisible by 4, to make sampling easier, but result was the same.
  Did try also to change texture allocation logic, but did not have success :)
  
  Let me know if you some  hints, hope to catch you on skype fora quick talk about it.
