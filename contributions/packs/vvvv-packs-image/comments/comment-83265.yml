  OK
  
  been tracking down some bugs today.
  
  1.  1. Security issue with EmguCV dll's
  
  Reported by desaxismundi and others. Is caused by drag-dropping the files out of the zip package rather than unzipping using Extract all... (confirmed in some cases, desaxis is still having troubles)
  
  1.  2. Some node's throwing exceptions 
  
  This is in some parts due to differences in vvvv28 (e.g. cloning spreads). I found this bug in FindBoard node, moving to vvvv28 fixes this issue.
  
  Suggests releasing 'stable' versions against each major vvvv release
