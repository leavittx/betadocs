  @mediadog thanks. Hmm, I really don't know how to fix this. Anyone got any ideas?
  
  My solution is to have a UPD connection between the x64 and x32 bit instances. I even had the x64 bit version start the x32 bit version via the ShellExecute node.. This is wasting a lot of time of many people, does anybody know how to fix it?
