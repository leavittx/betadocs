  hi all,
  
  ImagePack_x64.7z - 25.11.16 <23:39%20UTC> by sebl @ 45beta24.2x64
  also tried some older builds, but not all of them.
  
  If I setup the CV.Image(VfW) to 1080p, I just get 480p streams out of it.
  one or two cams, without repeater - same issue. Logitech 910B HD.
  
  elliots videoin is red, altough i have visual studio installed..
  any ideas?
