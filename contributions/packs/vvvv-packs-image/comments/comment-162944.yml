  Hi Node Jogglers
  
  I want to run 2 PS3 Eye Cams with the CL drivers
  
  The describtion here says
  'CLEye (i.e. PlayStation eye) is currently disabled but can be back v. soon'
  
  Is this outdated or still true?
  Cause I also can not get them to run, although the CL-Eye Test works.
  Actually the Devices node shows one of them, but no video ~
  
  Cheers!
