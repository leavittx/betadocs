  @zeos : i've been able to get 60fps QVGA and 30fps VGA
  i use xtion pro live and kinect
  
  i think the issue is that perhaps you're using xtion pro (i.e. not the 'live' version) which has no rgb feed, and i haven't coded for that case sorry
  i'll try and have a look next time i'm in that project, else hassle me more!
  
  @mrboni - as on Skype (and for others here) - each user is given a colour equal to their User ID (e.g. 1,2,3,4,etc)
  since these colours are very dark, you won't see them in an AsTexture
  
  You can however use the = node to select a user from this image (which outputs 255 per pixel where that user id is present)
