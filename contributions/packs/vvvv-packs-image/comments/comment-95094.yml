  i've got following issue with the ps3eye:
  
  when plugged directly into my macbook pro the <span class="node">VideoIn (CLEye)</span> works as expected. when using an usb extension cable (which acts like a hub) this node does not recognise the camera, but i can utilise it without any problems with <span class="node">VideoIn (DShow9)</span>. therefore i believe it has nothing to do with the datarate over the extension. 
  
  did anyone use the ps3eye with this plugin with an extension/hub successfully?
