  I have a similar problem as @fatalex.
  
  Windows 10, x64bit, newest alpha or newest beta x64. 
  Using only the imagepack, without any other pack installed.
  
  I can create the node CalibrateCamera, I'm getting appropriate error messages when I don't give it enough input and hit solve.
  
  However when I do give it enough input and hit solve, I get this and vvvv crashes:
  
  ![error](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/imagepack.JPG) 
  
  (Can't copy the text)
  
  Any help?
  Getting nvcuda didn't help.
