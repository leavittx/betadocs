  Loving the x64 version!  BUT, the x64 camera and projector calibration nodes do not work properly: First use after loading they return sort-of-close results, and then on the second solve vvvv crashes.  Sometimes the first solve attempt crashes.
  
  I can take the exact same set of 3D and 2D points and node settings in the x86 version and it works perfectly - the correction is dead-on  (say 3px error vs. x64 70px error) and no crashes with repeated solutions.  And the vpm1 x86 gives the same results as the b33 x86 version.
  
  Any ideas?  Anyone have the x64 calibrations working?  Maybe mismatched compiler flags in the x64 build?
