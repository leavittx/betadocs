  hey all
  sorry for the silence
  
  @robe - there are 2 VideoIn nodes (one is video for windows, the other is directshow)
  have you tried with both. the vfw one doesn't support capture properties so may be better for you?
  also (including a discussion right now on skype with colorsound) a dedicated ps3eye / opencv plugin is really the way to go (as you say)
  need to merge that  earlier code (with texture out) into opencv version
  
  @circuitb
  timestamp is currently for structured light
  when you encode a frame it gets timestamped, and then when you recieve it you look for a matching timestamp
  since with normal directshow cameras you have no idea what the delay of the camera is, you can manually adjust the timestamp offset with that videoin's timestamp pin
  
  
  apologies about openni compatability
  in future i'll mark which openni version the release was made (with download links to get the files)
