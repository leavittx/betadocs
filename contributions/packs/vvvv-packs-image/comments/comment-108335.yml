  thanks. tried that. they would prob work, but it don't know where the input came from. if someone could take a look for me it would be appreciated.
  
  the patch in question is: 
  
  - FindBoardsInWorld   (..\packs\Image\nodes\modules\Image\OpenNI\ )
  
  the nodes that were missing are(, and the paths referenced): 
  
  - Length (Vector)   (..addonpacklib\nodes\modules\Vector\ )
  - WaitForCalm (Animation)   (..addonpacklib\nodes\modules\Animation\ )
  
  (..i already had WaitForCalm from something else)
