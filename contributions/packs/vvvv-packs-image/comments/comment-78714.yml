  Hi Desaxismundi,
  Seems that the CaptureProperty node doesn't work with the Ps3eye:
  - The Property window is unclickable (The checkers and the slider are gray)
  - The Property List (Gain, exposure, white balance) doesn't affect the image.
  
  **Anyone can confirm this?**
  
  It works very well with another webcam that I have here to test. (Philips)
  
  Thanks
