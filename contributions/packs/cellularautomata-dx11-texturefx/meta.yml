  Cyclic Cellular Automata were first developed by David Griffeath at the University of Wisconson.
  1. Take a 2D grid of cells.
  2. Select a maximum number of states each cell can have.
  3. Select a threshold value.
  4. Fill the cells with random state values between 0 and (maximum states-1).
  5. At each step of the simulation every cell follows these rules;
  a) Count how many neighbouring cells (Moore or Von Neumann neighborhoods) surrond the cell with a value of the current cellâ€™s state + 1
  b) If the count is greater or equal to the threshold value then the cell state is incremented by 1
  6. Repeat this process as long as you want to.

  NOTE: "ProvaColori.tfx" is needen just to have same color as in example
  NOTE: some configurations ("Fuzz (Jason Rampe)=4/4/7/N",Diamond Spirals (Jason Rampe)=1/1/15/N) not works, no idea why. The image in the preview is : 1/1/17/M
  thanks to tonfilm for some useful hint!
