  The LFO is missing, and from the FMsynthesis Girlpower patch. The Oscillators patch is pretty confusing, with broken links and only works when it loads up. I guess this has something to do with the ADSR node.
  
  Ideally to understand what each does I think it would be easier if they were demonstrated in separate patches. At the moment I don't understand how to use them, but I'll experiment. Quite excited though.
