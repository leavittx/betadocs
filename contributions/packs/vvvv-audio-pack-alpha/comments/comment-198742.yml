  Hey Tonfilm.  Amazing work!
  
  I'm testing the Ambsonic vst plugins here <http://www.matthiaskronlachner.com/?p=2015> using a 4 channel 1st order bformat wav, and converting to binaural using ambix_binaural_o1.dll
  
  This is working really well!  I want to rotate the soundfield in realtime and there is a vst in the pack for this (ambix_rotator_o1.dll)
  
  When loading this vst for some reason no gui is visible, though there is one when using the plugin in reaper. In the info view I can see the parameters I want (yaw / roll / pan), and I can expose the first one by pressing 'expose', but as I cant move the controls in the gui I can't get at the other two.  Any ideas?
  
  Thanks!
