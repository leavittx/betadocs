  Hi there,
  I'm having a strange issue with the "AudioEngine (VAudio) <ASIO>)" node. If i select the "ASIO4ALL" driver VVVV completely crashes. I already tried to get some Information with the TTY Renderer without success. I just wanted to copy the project from one to another workstation(It's working there). I copied the entire VVVV-Folder including all packs etc. an installed all drivers including ASIO4ALL.
  The driver ist accessible trough the systemsettings.
  Do you have any idea what i could do, or who i could catch the error for further troubleshooting.
