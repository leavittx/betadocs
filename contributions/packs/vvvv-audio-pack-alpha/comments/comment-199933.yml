  hi mrboni, sorry for the long delay. the plugin you are trying to lead has no GUI defined by the developer. the UI which you see in your audio software is a generic UI provided by the DAW. most DAWs have this kind of fallback, but its not yet implemented in VAudio, see the known bugs section.
  
  so either you have some funding to implement this in VAudio or you can ask the developer whether he is planning to provide a UI for his plugins which do not have one yet... quite a few in the current ambiX pack.
