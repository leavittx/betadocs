  DirectX11 rendering for vvvv (update 1.3)
  
  See changes here: [directx11-1.3-update](/blog/directx11-1.3-update)
  
  1.3.1 :
  * Adds a small bug fix in case two group or enabled layers are stacked (exception would prevent rest of the groups to process)
  * Adds a small issue if texture FX is in a disabled patch, sometimes would not resume.
  * TextureFX that can use "wantmips" now do so (Edge, Blur, BlurDirectional, BlurGlow, BlurPerfector, DistortFlow, DropShadow, UnsharpMask) . They are all faster in that scenario.
  
  General Changelog here : 
  https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
  
  Requires vvvv beta33.7 or newer.
  
  Install Guide:
  * Download relevant version
