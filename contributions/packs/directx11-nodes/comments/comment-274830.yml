  I think the problem people have is that to use vvvv beta commercially, you need dx11 pack. And it looks like the continuity of dx11 is independant of the vvvv group, ergo, vvvv beta depends of outside development to be a valid commercial product.
  
  Dont know about the more acute feelings some of the people express, im in another continent so not really involved in that drama, but at least thats what I get from here.
