  @microdee I agree.
  In vvvv beta, DX11 is essential and it would be sad to see it stagnate. so a sustainable solution where it can continue to be maintained would be desirable. I just hope that it can be worked out somehow. Unfortunately I am currently not in a situation where I can provide anything other than moral support, so I can just hope that it will work out somehow.
  
  PS happy new year
