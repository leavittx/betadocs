  00:00:36 ERR : Exception occured during creation of plugin: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Program Files (x86)\vvvv_45beta30.2_x64\packs\DX11\nodes\plugins\VVVV.DX11.Nodes.dll' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.
  00:00:36  -  : To help us track this error down, enable the ExceptionDialog via the menu or starting vvvv with /showexceptions.
