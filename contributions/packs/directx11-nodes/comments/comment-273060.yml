  I had trouble playing H265 and ProRes files with the VLC node.
  
  To fix it i went to \packs\dx11\nodes\plugins\vlc folder and removed the following files/folders:
  * libvlc.dll
  * libvlccore.dll
  * plugins folder
  
  Then i downloaded and installed the latest VLC from their site and copied the above files from VLC install folder back to DX11 pack in their respective places.
  
  So far is working fine :)
