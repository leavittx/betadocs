  may I suggest devvvvs pull their heads out of their own bubble, grow some balls, break this communication and licensing deadlock, stop the fingerpointing and take the first steps writing to vux the following letter: ahem

  Dear Mr. Vux!
  
  I hope we find you in good health! We noticed after all these years that anyone who downloaded vvvv and wanted to draw more than 15 quads on the screen also needed to install your DX11 for vvvv pack. We also noticed that lately the aforementioned pack didn't receive as much care and update as it used to be. For this reason we would like to request your permission to make your wonderful and irreplaceable contribution an official part of vvvv which means we would continue maintaining it and it would be covered by the vvvv licensing terms. This would also mean we would include the DX11 codebase in the vvvv-sdk repository. We're aware that by this "merger" the DX11 pack would lose its own licensing which is different than vvvv is using, however we're sure we can find an agreement regarding compensation. Especially this became important matter for us when we included our first DX11 shader in the officially endorsed addon-pack.
  
  Thank you in advance, and looking forward to hearing from you!
  
  Best regards:
  The vvvv Development Team

  now copy paste this and send it to Vux. To which he will probably respond
  
  "yeah do whatever you want, I don't care about any of this. Peace!"
  
  and by this minimal amount of social and communication effort the world would become a better place for many.
  
  I know devvvvs attention now is 75% at VL shenanigans but please, after 7 years of legal/personal/philosophical dispute regarding "dx11 becomes vvvvanilla" topic, can you put it behind, and stop playing 3D chess against your own minds, and just do it?
