  i got it working, but my old dx9 nodes are not listed any more
  but if i open an old patch, they are there, and they work, i can control c+v and use them,,, is this normal or i made a mistake on the installation ?
  
  and is there a way to convert a dx11 texture into a dx9 texuture to use the old patches ?
