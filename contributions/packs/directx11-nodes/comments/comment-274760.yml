  I believe, that vvvv license sales would have stopped around 2017, if it weren't for vux' and his dx11. 
  It was always weird to me, that devvvvs never truely appreciated or even properly acknowledged that fact (besides a spraypainted quad). 
  This had bothered me so much, that I took the opportunity to call for financial reimbursement when I was on stage last NODE. Fortunately, a few users responded, either with one-time-payments to vux, or his patreon.
  
  But again, this relates more to the gnarly relationship between the devvvvs and vux. While devvvvs didn't hesitate to become gold sponsors of Virgile, they never seemed to even consider something similar for vux, even though their product has been heavily depending on this very contribution.
  
  So yeah, I endorse microdee's initiative whole heartedly, and would love to see an improvement to the status quo.
