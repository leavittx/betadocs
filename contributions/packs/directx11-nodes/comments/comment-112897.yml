  I keep getting an error in the TTY renderer from one of the DX11 nodes. Not really sure what is happening but this is the error:
  
  Stacktrace:
  
     at VVVV.PluginInterfaces.V2.Spread`1.get_Item(Int32 index)
     at VVVV.DX11.Nodes.Renderers.Graphics.DX11VolumeRendererNode.Update(IPluginIO pin, DX11RenderContext context)
     at VVVV.DX11.Nodes.Renderers.Graphics.DX11VolumeRendererNode.Render(DX11RenderContext context)
     at VVVV.DX11.Lib.RenderGraph.DX11DeviceRenderer.ProcessNode(DX11Node node)
  04:39:39 ERR : System.DivideByZeroException in VVVV.PluginInterfaces: Attempted to divide by zero.
  
  It is logged a few times per second and also makes "ML?" blink constantly in the Perf Meter.
  
  I am using 32.1 64bit with the latest DX11 pack release (05.12.13) and all this is happening while the rendering (using mre.mdmod 2.1) is working fine.
  
  The problem is that its making the TTY render useless for debugging, as this error gets logged so often.
