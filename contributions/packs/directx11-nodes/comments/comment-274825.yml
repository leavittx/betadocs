  You are arguing, that you've highlighted the quality of vux' contribution, but that was never in question. My point was that you never fully acknowledged what an essential cornerstone the contribution was and is to the well-being of vvvv group. 
  Why would you rather bloat the "slim core" with comatose ex9 for years than just admitting that vux has been providing the gpu features that vvvv group could have but didn't. 
  Now, vux never asked for anything in return, but it fills me with worry that you seem to think that means he does not need anything. What happened to T.R.U.S.T.?

  That's the world we want to live in. 
  If vvvv-dx11 helps you make a living, then help make vux a living, by providing vvvv-dx11 to you.
  </div>
  
  Now, you got much better data than anyone to check how many commercial licensees are using dx11 (from your annual surveys), so please doublecheck. But just believe me when I tell you that EX9 does not deliver enough grapic punch that would have justified buying vvvv licenses ever since Instancing, Kinect2, Particles, Noodles, etc was common place. In some cases you gave head nods to that fact (see Spout, PBR, Craftlie).
  That should tell you that vvvv group did benefit in an extraordinary way; intellectually, commercially, and financially. 
  
  Before you try to lecture David, you could rather look inside his frustration. Sure, draw up your own letter to vux instead of copy and pasting it, but make tabula rasa. Find out how you can help him, maybe it is not even money he needs, but please for the love of tasty vanilla code and streamlined installs, show some earnest gratitude that this man has silently saved your beta sales for the last couple years and will continue for at least another year.
  
  I really hope you end up with a refreshed collaboration, that does not feel like a one-way-road to many around here. Now this was a lot on the interpersonal level of the issue, so let me get back to the factual:
  
  DX11 is the de facto standard gpu pipeline for beta (even including vl), it would only be honest and helpful for everybody if this would be reflected in the vanilla beta as well.
