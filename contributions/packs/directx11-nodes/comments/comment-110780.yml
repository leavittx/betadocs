  hi first of all thanks again for the great work all the time!
  
  Just one problem. When I upgrade to the latest release all connections to quads are missing in my project. 
  
  Is it somehow avoidable so that you can smoothly migrate projects over the upcoming DX11 releases? Anyone else had this problem?
  
  Cheers
