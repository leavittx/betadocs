  hi, i'm very happy about the new pack, so finally we can have dx9 and 11 with th same vvvv. I really like and appreciate your hard work ;)
  
  the only thing i'm not able to use is the facetracking of kinect (no dx9 and no dx11).
  The node becomes red after i activate rgb, depth and skeleton (but i think they are needed to facetrack).
  am i doing something wrong? or it's not working ?
  
  cheers, and big work. 
  was a pleasure to meet you, vux, in london some days ago :D
