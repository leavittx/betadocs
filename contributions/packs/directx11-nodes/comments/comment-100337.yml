  @ft : I changed AA for next build, so it will be easier to use (Now AA Samples per pixel is an enum, and i removed quality, since it never looked like to make any difference).
  
  Quite decent amount of other fixes in next build, including:
  * Kinect with all textures + Face Tracker
  * Support for IUserInputWindow (Mouse/Keyboard state)
  * DynamicBuffer nodes fix in case of nil input
  * Reflect on shader if geometry layout is invalid (reports missing semantic)
  * ReadBack fix on first frame
  * Memory leak fix on Texture 3D
  * Memory leak fix on dynamic buffer
  * Texture FX does proper cleanup after finishing
  * GeomFX crash fix when attached to Query
  * Image shader has Force Resolution Pin (so it uses size input instead of initial texture size)
  * Quad (Layer) : replicating old quad, with auto batching ))
  
  Also now feraltic is included as submodule, so check out should build out of the box.
