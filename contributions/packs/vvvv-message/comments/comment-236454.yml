  Hello velcrome!
  
  I have for the last few weeks been getting to grips with your message pack and really loving it. I am using it for an elaborate preset loading and saving mechanism of about 140 different parameters, each with about 10 attributes.
  
  To be able to load older presets even if I add new things, I need a way to edit the existing messages and overwrite the attributes of all the messages with existing topics. Edit(Message) does the trick, but I cannot specify topics there, so it just edits the values in the order they came in. I need something like Edit, but being able to specify which topics to change.
  
  Say I set up using ConfigKeep 3 messages:
  
  topic:Speed,
  property:Speed,
  value:1
  
  topic:Lightness,
  property:Lightness,
  value:0.5
  
  topic:Saturation,
  property:Saturation,
  value:0.1
  
  Now I have a preset I want to load, which contains those messages as well. I can just read the preset (from .json file), split and use edit with Force to inject the new values.
  
  But how can I edit those 3 messages if the preset I am loading only contains 2 of those and in a different order? I assumed I could just use ConfigKeep again but Force it, but that doesn't seem to work as expected - it only changes the messages coming out of ConfigKeep, but not the messages of the same topic and formular globally!? To be able to get to the topic I actually have another field called property, which uses the same string as the topic.
  
  I need something like EditByTopic, where I can input a bunch of messages like Edit, but then have an input for Topic and any of the fields I choose like ConfigKeep and it sets the values for the messages with the existing topics.
  
  I hope this makes some sense. Best, Armin.
