  Cheers,
  
  pretty handy contribution, using it a lot.
  But when using, i was thinking about the necessity of the connections at all.
  
  Why not declare Message to the new S+R Nodes...!?
  
  Message(Join) as a generic Datatype, that can handle everything and Message(Split) just as an reciever. So instead of the "Message-Input" of Message(Split), there could be just the Adress of some Message.
  
  And with Message-Type there is a way of sorting adresses.
  For Example when Message(Join) is type Event and Message(Split) also, Message split would only show up Messages of Type Event.
  
  Would be The End of all the S+R hassle and patching would be much more <3!
  
  Just some thoughts...
  
  Ahoi
