  confirm, will look for a solution. i usually only need the x64 variants, so x86 doesn't get the same attention.
  
  on a side note, the github version is much better right now, but requires compiling it. 
  
  edit: done. there has been some work under the hood since 2.0, because vvvv-Message was being used for in-house projects, so quite a few quirks surfaced and were consequently improved. have fun
