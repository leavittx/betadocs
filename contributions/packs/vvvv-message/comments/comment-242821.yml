  @mfo can you share the patch? The Formular node turns red, if it cannot parse your definition and will reject the update bang. That can admittedly be confusing, but I never had a case, where this "didn't work" for a valid definition.
  
  Also, the vpm script downloads and unzips the very same zips from the github releases, so missing dlls seem unlikely (maybe try with 7zip.exe?!)
