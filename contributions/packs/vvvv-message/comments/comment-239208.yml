  Cannot confirm on a fresh beta35.5_x64 with vvvv-Message, installed with vpm. Unfortunately the log you provided does not show any hint of the reason this happens to you. 
  Can you please start a new thread (or a github issue, as you wish) with a link to a full startup log? Please also leave details, like your pc specs, and do you use x64 too? Which dx11-vvvv (or any other packs) do you use?
