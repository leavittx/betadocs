  **One question about performance:**  
  My message would have the complexity of let's say 5 spreads of 8 floats each and 5 spreads of 4 bools each. 
  If a MIDI message changes a single value, in practise one of the spreads has to be sent and parsed for each MIDI message coming in, right? Unless i split the message into having 60 individual members. 
  I can't imagine that latency will stay down either way? 
  In comparison to *Eksposing*, isn't this a lot more string parsing behind the curtain?  
  
  Disclaimer: I'd be using about six different instances of such a message receiver with individual addresses.
