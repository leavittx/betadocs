  In the past, vvvv-Message lacked documentation, and I can understand anyone not investing the time with all these nodes, all doing very strange things here. 
  Because for basic scenarios, you might have to first learn them all? And to add to the bizarr: Just to read this, you'd have to scroll through endless lists of exceptions, that these nodes are producing?
  
  But again, everything you know is wrong.
  
  Start with a <span class="node">ConfigKeep</span> node, and go from there with a <span class="node">Split</span>, an <span class="node">Edit</span> maybe. Those three nodes alone can make a tremendous difference in your patching experience. Read help patches, and learn at your own pace. 
  
  This is a major release here, and it's got half a year extra to be polished, thanks to the late release of beta35. So the suite is tested, prod ready and [documented](https://github.com/velcrome/vvvv-Message/blob/master/src/MessageNodes/readme.md)- also in code and patch.
