  This new version is so fresh, some critical features are only working with the current alpha.
  
  It now comes with a quick "Formular" definition to type your stuff across your vvvv application, with an advanced concept to hold Messages that I coined "Keep" and some nifty pin-management to detect actual changes and only then get active.
  
  Dive in quickly with the 101 course in the girlpower directory. For more detailed information book [one of the last few spots](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/object-oriented-patching-vobjects-and-messages) 
  
  As always, feedback is welcome, and so is a flattr.
