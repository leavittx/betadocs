  which version did you try, x64 or x86? the one that is for download on the top of the page? 
  
  if you used the latest version from github you will have to compile in a different ide than vvvv, because as of yet vvvv does not support native nuget management.
  
  anyway, thanks for hint with the csproj. if the pack is properly installed in /packs, it will automatically replace the nodes by their compiled counterpart in VVVV.Nodes.Messaging.dll, but will not reflect this autoreplace after saving the v4p, this needs to be done manually.
