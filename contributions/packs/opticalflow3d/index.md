Based on the OF2D-contribution of [otosatram](http://vvvv.org/users/otosatram), this pack is adding also calculations for the Z-axis. Check out the help-patch for how to calibrate and setup the whole thing.

Including an example, which shows how to use the OF3D together with the DX11.Particles-pack.

Currently only supports Kinect2.

**Installation**:

Just drop it in the Pack-folder.
