  Pre node15 build, new features and some bug fixes, still badly lacks documentation, I know ;)
  
  Latest update:
  * Update to latest public sdk.
  * Self contained, dependencies should all be there
  * Support for some textures as raw (easier to use in compute shaders).
  * Face and HdFace
  * Experimental gesture support
  * Experimental fusion support
  * Some help patches (finally)
  * Breaking change : Kinect skeleton tracking Id is now a string and not value anymore.
  
  Disclaimer (from Microsoft):
  “This is preliminary software and/or hardware and APIs are preliminary and subject to change.”
  
  Same disclaimer for me, don't complain if a pin gets broken in a future release ;)
  
  Note:
  * Requires Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
  * Requires DX11 pack 
  * Only Works in 64 bits version
  
  Install:
  simply put the \kinect2 directory that is in the .zip in your \packs directory.
