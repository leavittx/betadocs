  Hi guys,
  
  I've just been trying to get the Kinect2 working with vvvv. I've downloaded the VVVV.Nodes_.Kinect2.zip file from this post and the latest (April) SDK from Microsoft.
  
  I've tried putting vux's files in a contributions folder (although I am unsure where each file should fall within that) and also the
  C:\Program Files\vvvv_45beta31.2_x64\packs\DX11\nodes\plugins
  folder as a guess.
  
  I can get something from the sample applications in the Microsoft SDK pack so I know the camera works, but I can't see anything in vvvv - only red nodes!
  
  Any help would be great, thank you!
