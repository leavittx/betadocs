  Hi Guys,
  
  My problem is:
  I have the nodes of Kinect2 in red without pins!
  What I have:
  I have windows 10, the kinect One is conneted to usb 3.0 of the pc, I use Vvvv 34.1x86, addonpack 34.1x86, I have put the packs folder in the some way of the addonpack (is close to licenses folder) with inside kinect2 folder (version b33.7 pack) and dx11 folder (version dx11 0.6.1.x86).
  
  Dx11 work on vvvv so it is ok.
  in the menu appear all kinect2 nodes but when I choose one for example the first one (kinect: device microsoft) it is in red and without pins! with renderer TTY is write: Exception occured during creation of plugin "..\vvvv_45beta34.1x86\packs\kinect2\nodes\vvvv.dx11.nodes.kinect2.dll"
  I tried with root to put the directory of the file, but don't work.
  
  Someone can help me, please?
  
  :(
