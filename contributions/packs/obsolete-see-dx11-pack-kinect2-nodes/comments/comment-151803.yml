  Hi - after getting a new USB 3.0 card (the onboard one crashed everytime after seconds) i finally got the kinect2 working - with the windows program 'kinect status'. 
  
  The patch seems to load fine, no red boxes - but the output is kinda dissapointing . Did anybody run into the same situation/has an idea how to deal with this?
  
  Thank you!!
