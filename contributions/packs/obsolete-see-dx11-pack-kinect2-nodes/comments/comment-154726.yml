  Make sure you download:
  
  64 bit vvvv 
  64 bit dx11 pack
  
  dx11 pack goes: \vvvv_45beta31.2_x64\packs\DX11
  so you seem to be good with the placing at least.
  
  The kinect patch and its dll can be anywhere.
  
  Do not forget to run the kinect service.
  Make sure to use the right vvvv if you happen to have
  also other versions installed.
  
  that should do
