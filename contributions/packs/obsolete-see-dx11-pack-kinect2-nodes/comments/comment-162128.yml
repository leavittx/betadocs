  i try  to use the RGBDepth with RelativeLookup Enabled as a displacement texture, 
  ![RgbDepth relativeLookup](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/_mainX64_13.08.56.png) 
  but it look really strange compared to the KinectV1 (Dx11)
  ![Vi RgbDepth](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/_mainX64_V1.12-13.16.52.png) 
  
  
  any ideas what's going wrong here ?
  thanks
