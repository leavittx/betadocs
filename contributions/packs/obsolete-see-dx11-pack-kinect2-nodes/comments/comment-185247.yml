  yes, i did :)
  and the solution is quite simple, i've found it followinf the error i always had. And it's about some missing files needed for facetracking.
  All you have to do is to take the nuidatabase folder (that should be something like "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\v2.0_1409\bin\NuiDatabase" and you have to copy the entire folder to your kinect2 pack folder. 
  And that's it, it works, and also very well ;)
