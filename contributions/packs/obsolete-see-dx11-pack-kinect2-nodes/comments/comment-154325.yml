  @metrowave kinect2 came with Xbox one works like kinect 2 dev kit. It's the same device perhaps the difference would be only in adhesives on the dev kit kinect...I have try in v4 both devices without notice differences.
  (but u need to have the adpter included in the dev kit)
  
  I can report next week if I found differences
