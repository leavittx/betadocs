  Quick recap for the next guy looking for infos , 
  
  you have to install the content of your zip in a folder named "packs" at the root of your vvvv folder 
  you will also need the dx11 pack to be installed in the same place 
  [directx11-nodes-alpha](xref:contribution/directx11-nodes)
  
  i still have a problem tho , i cant get the kinect2 node to appear by starting it from vvvv i have to start the help file from the kinect2 folder :(
