  Whoever replied to my post, thank you for the help!
  
  I've got 64 bit vvvv and DX11 pack in the right place.
  
  I've got the Kinect patch and its dll in: vvvv_45beta31.2_x64\contributions\plugins
  
  Just checked the services - Kinect Monitor is running in Automatic start-up (I assume that's OK).
  
  I ran the patch and only some of the Kinect2 Microsoft nodes are red now (see attached screenshot).

  Any ideas?
  Thanks again!
