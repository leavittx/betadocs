  Hi,
  Can't get it to work...
  
  Win 8.1
  First SDK
  vvvv_45beta31.2_x64
  DX11 packs
  - No red nodes, but nothing on render...
  
  Win 8.1
  March SDK
  vvvv_45beta31.2_x64
  DX11 packs
  - Red nodes :)
  
  I can get data from Kinectstatus but not from vvvv.
  
  I supose we have to wait until April SDK before a node update, right? :P
  
  Thanks!
