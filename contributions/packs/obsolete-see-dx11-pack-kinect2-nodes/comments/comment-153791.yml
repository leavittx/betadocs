  Just set up Kinect 2.  Installed new sdk (March update). All samples and kinect studio are working.
  
  vvvv plugin nodes are red though
  
  error:
  
  00:00:09 ERR : Exception occured during creation of plugin: Could not load type 'Microsoft.Kinect.KinectStatus' from assembly 'Microsoft.Kinect, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'
  
  
  any ideas?  maybe the sdk update has broken the plugins?
