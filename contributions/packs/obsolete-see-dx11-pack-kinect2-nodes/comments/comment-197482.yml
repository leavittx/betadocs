  I'm very new to VVVV, so this might be a very basic question. How to install the those Nodes? I was able to test the patches from the kinec2 folder, but can't add the kinect2 nodes to new patches. Also some nodes don't have any pins
  (..appear red first then turn grey).
  
  Would be glad if somebody could explain what I have to do. Thx!
