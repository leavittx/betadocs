  It is released!  Anyone can download the SDK now, and two units arrived here today.  Through contacts at MS they are saying these are the "RTM" (release to manufacturing) units.
  
  What DX11 contribution are you referring to?  The only ones I can find other than this one are for the K1.  I'll try one of the older SDKs.  Thanks Gareth!
