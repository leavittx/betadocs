  @StiX: +1, would beinteresting for me, too! for the moment you can use a color-spread as input for the player-node to differentiate between the different users.

  I have the Kinect v2 running here, work's well. But sometimes there is a strange behaviour. I'm not sure when it apprears, but mostly when multiple users pop in randomly or when it's difficult for the kinect to detect my skeleton (eg sitting on a chair). 
  
  The Kinect stream then seems to be freezed for many seconds (not sending any new data at all / holding the last data), while all the other animations in vvvv are running at 60+ fps. 
  
  Any ideas? How can i debug that?
