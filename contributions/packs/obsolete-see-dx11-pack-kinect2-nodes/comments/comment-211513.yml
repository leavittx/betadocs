  Just updated from a version I compiled myself a while back, and find that the Skeleton node User Index pin, which used to return a number, now returns a lengthy string of dubious utility - a long string of numbers.  Looks more like a string representation of a resource handle or something.
  
  Is this a bug?  Why did this change?
