This repository introduces the **PathGeometry** from [Windows.Media](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.pathgeometry(v=vs.110).aspx) to vvvv. It helps you to manipulate 2d polylines.

* It gives you 2 prototypes (rectangle and ellipse) and a way to create **your own polygons**.
* It has tools to **analyse**polygons (area and bounds)
* It comes with all the **typical nodes** you need to build applications (getslice, select, group, change, queue, s+h)
* It has **boolean operations** to merge and mangle polygons.
* It has helper modules to transform polygons into **Layers** and **Meshes**.
* It has 3 kinds of **hittests**.
* It has extensive **helpfiles**.
* 
* It is **fully**spreadable.
* It is **fast**as lightning.
* It is **open**and **free**.
