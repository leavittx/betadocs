  This looks really great, I'm interested in doing some 2d animation and this looks very useful for it. When I try to use the 'Mesh' plugin included in the pack I get some odd results though. Does the PathGeometry package only support convex shapes? See here for an example of what I'm talking about:

  Thanks for the contribution!
