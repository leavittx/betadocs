  @sebl: i had the same problem and resolved it by putting a cli_cppuhelper.dll obtained from [rather dubious sources](http://www.4shared.com/get/uNTiksfA/cli_cppuhelper.html) (but scanned for virii with onlinescanner) into the PathGeometry\plugins\2D.GeometryChange\bin directory.
  
  also bigup to velcrome for this nice plug!
