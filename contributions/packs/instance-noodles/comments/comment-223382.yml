  I had a look at adding zip/unzip nodes, seems like a good idea.  I think this should be via plugin though & to be honest I had a lot of trouble to get started with DX11 plugins.  If anyone can help me get sorted with some VS solution files to start with I'd be happy to take a crack at writing some though.
