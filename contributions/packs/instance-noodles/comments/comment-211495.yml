  Sorry it does work on 64bit but in my patch (both 32 and 64) I have to reselect it to make it work.
  
  It seems like that the Control Points Per Spline is not spreadable, is that possible?
  
  And, how to make it draw sharp edges on control points? The only way I ve found is to add a vertex before and after and very close to each incoming vertex but that is not optimal of course.
