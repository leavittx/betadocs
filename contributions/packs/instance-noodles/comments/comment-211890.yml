  just for reference that might help others:
  
  i've had issues installing the pack. many of the patches did not work - either the gsfx files were not loaded or the renderer did not output anything for whatever reason (even though the fx files did load fine, no red nodes).
  
  i could get the whole thing running though after renaming the packs folder from "InstanceNoodles Alpha 0.2.1" just to "InstanceNoodles".
