  @panki does you Macbook have a discrete graphics card? 
  
  Noodles heavily leverages DirectX 11 and your GPU for performance so I hope tis nothing to do with [Macbook Pros and their motherboards](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/macbook-pro-graphics-failures-addressed-by-apple-repair-programme-3497935/). 
  
  I had a similar issue instancing with an Intel internal gpu machine. It just didn't like instancing. Check if the DX11 girlpower for instancing works okay too.
