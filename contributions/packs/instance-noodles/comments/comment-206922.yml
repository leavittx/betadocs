  * Spline count works here, did you try with the help patch?  Be sure to take loop off if you are not making loop paths.
  * The radius buffer is lets you set thickness per spline.  May add a per segment mode later as well. 
  * Do you mean to texture with gradient or?  in that case just use gradient (dx11.texturefx)
