  Hello everybody.
  
  Every time I try to open the "02_DX11.GeomFX_Instancing.v4p" example on to the girlpower folder, my laptop stops working and then I need to force a restart by pressing the start button.
  
  The other patches in the same folder are running ok.
  
  I wonder if I am the only one having this issue, or if itÂ´s just that my laptop is not capable to run it. 
  
  the laptop is a 2012 macbook pro, 4 GB Ram and solid disk with native windows 10 (I know is not the best option but it is what I have.)
  
  Any suggestion would be helpful.
  
  Thanks in advantage.
