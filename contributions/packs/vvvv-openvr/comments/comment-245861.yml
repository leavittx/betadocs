  Just trying this out for the first time, but I keep getting a red node for the Camera(OpenVR) when opening the OpenVRDemo.v4p from girlpower:
  
  ![title](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/https://img3.picload.org/image/dgcadgcr/openvr_camera.jpg) 
  
  SteamVR is on latest beta and running, freshly installed vvvv 35.8, latest DX11, latest VVVV.OpenVR, GTX1070. Any ideas?
  
  SteamVR says (unresponsive) vvvv.exe
