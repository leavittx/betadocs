  I'm facing some lag in the vive headset view after installing the new version (18/01/17) at every movement, as if I'm still at 90 fps. I mean every movement duplicate the content for a short time. It creates a bad feeling and a real vr sickness.  this was not the case in the previous version. 
  Maybe someone as some idea how to fix it?
  Many thanks
