  new behaviour arrived - i start vvvv with vr running (vive) - everything works
  if i will turn controller off and on while vvvv vr is running, it stops receiving all buttons from the controller, dashboard works, tracking works, i can ping the controller, but vvvv does not get buttons, only after i restart vvvv AND vr as well, can someone confirm?
