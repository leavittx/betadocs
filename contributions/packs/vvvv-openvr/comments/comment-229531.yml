  hello,
  
  with SteamVr autoupdate everything goes wrong!
  my DK2 rig was working perfectly with vvvv.openvr V1 with early september steamVR version.
  with the new update i try every combination between SteamVR, SteamVR beta, vvvv.openvr V1/V2/V3 with no luck, no more vvvv Rendering in the headset
  i've this compositor error message in vvvv:
  
  <div class="box">
  Unsupported texture format. Make sure texture uses RGBA, is not compressed and has no mipmaps.
  </div>
  
  and SteamVr says:
  <div class="box">
  (unresponsive) vvvv.exe
  </div>
  
  the vr_client_Steam log file says:
  <div class="box">
  Sat Oct 08 2016 11:53:17.502 - error VRInitError_Init_LowPowerWatchdogNotSupported when initing driver oculus_legacy from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\drivers\oculus_legacy\bin\win32\driver_oculus_legacy.dll.

  </div>
  sounds like a SteamVr issue more than a vvvv one!
  any ideas
  
  thanks
