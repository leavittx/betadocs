  Hey guys, how can I stream VR player on the screen with chromakey body? Like on that video: <https://youtu.be/Ikz5uJ0KE3w>  . You see, that man is playing the game,and we also can see his body. I understand that he has something green or blue befind him, and other "VR operator" shooting him and stream it with his body? How can I do it?
