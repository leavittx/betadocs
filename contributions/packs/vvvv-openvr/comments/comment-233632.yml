  Feature request:
  
  Inspired by Dat.Gui for WebVR:
  ![title](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/https://github.com/dataarts/dat.guiVR/raw/master/preview.gif)
  
  The option to 'expose' IOBoxes to VR, to have an interface similar to the one in Dat.Gui VR!

  (I'd actually love to do it myself if there's support!)
