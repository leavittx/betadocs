  Thanks tonfilm and supporters!
  
  The Poser node is CPU intensive (8000 ticks in debug mode). I can't get a perfect 90fps with the OpenVRdemo..
  
  When WaitForSync=0, Poser is 100 ticks, perfect 90 fps. 
  But I can see the double lines in motion... 
  The motion is perfect only with WaitForSync=1.
  
  Any idea for a workaround or other ways to decrease the Poser CPU consemption?
  What is the role of WaitForSync?
  thanks!
