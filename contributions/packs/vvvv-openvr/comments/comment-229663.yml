  Hi Tonfilm,
  
  Thanks a lot for your answer, I think my problem was with me installing the Oculus SDK and SteamVR wrong. Anyway - after uninstalling everything and installing again it works with the newest version of oculus sdk (1.8), steamVR etc. 
  
  I should have deleted my question, but got carried away in the new good energy eager :)
  
  Have a good evening!
