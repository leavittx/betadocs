  i've checked the repo and found the place that requires some change:
  
  [OpenVRManager.cs Line 48](https://github.com/tebjan/VVVV.OpenVR/blob/master/src/VVVV.OpenVR.Core/Core/OpenVRManager.cs#L48)
  
  if you have a vive and someone with basic c# skills you can hack it. otherwise you have to wait until we have a vive setup here in the office and i have to time to dig into it.
