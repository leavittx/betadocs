  @tonfilm: I understand that you have already tried Riftcat and that it is not working properly yet.
  Anyway, it's good news that there is a chance ... I would like to use a few (4-6) Playstation move in my project, not necessarily as a Vive substitute. Data which I need is position, rotation and location in space. For now, I managed to pair them with Win7 PC and receive a stream of data via UDP. So far, I have not managed to translate received data to useful values.
  I thought maybe it will be simpler and more elegant if I use OpenVR ...
