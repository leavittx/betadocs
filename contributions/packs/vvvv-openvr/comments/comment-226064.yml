  Righteous!  Works great on my Sager laptop with 2x GTX870Ms in SLI.  I do see the double image on motion in the Vive HMD and not on the laptop display; I think that may be because my cards are below VR spec.  @ggml and @u7angel what cards are you using?  I'll try it on a desktop GTX970 and see what happens...
  
  Thanks to all, really excellent contribution!
