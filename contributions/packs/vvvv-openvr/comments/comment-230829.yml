  is it right that the connection to steamvr only works if the oculus patch is in focus? so if i minimize (alt+3) it, vvvv.exe "is not responding".
  is there any workaround?
  
  and furthermore, are there any more dependencies for the second girlpower patch "patch in vr"? i have a few red nodes with hard links. the title had me quiet interested, as i'm still wondering how to get my patching window into vr.
  
  thanks in advance, huge contribution!
