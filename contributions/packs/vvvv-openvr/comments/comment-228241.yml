  hi all,
  
  first of all great thanks to tonfilm and all others for bringing this to vvvv.
  
  i am currently trying to move the controller's origin (or axis center) to another location in the controller, but no luck so far.
  
  i edited the .obj files origin in the steam/steamapps/.../vr_controller_vive_1_5 which is used in the ViveController node, but that obviously only changes the rendered model.
  
  i also looked at the json file in that folder but couldn't figure out if this is the right place.
  
  if anybody could give me directions on this it would help me a lot.
  
  cheers!
