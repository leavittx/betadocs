  hallo @hhdev nice to hear that it helped you prototyping. the trackers should just appear in the list of tracked devices the same as the controllers. but i have never tested it personally and haven't heard form anyone who tried it. if you have them and it won't work it should be a quick fix. if you are located in berlin, as the video suggests, it would be helpful to get the tracker for an afternoon to test it...
