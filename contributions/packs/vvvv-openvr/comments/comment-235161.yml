  @499reality I have always seen the same thing, but only when actually moving.  If I just rotate my head everything is smooth.
  
  I suspect that with just rotation the update is happening in the OpenVR software (it can just slide the texture while doing the next render), but a move means that whole new textures from vvvv are needed.
  
  Are you sure you weren't seeing the smooth pan before and now seeing the rougher images during movement?  If you just turn your head is it smooth?
  
  I think movement double image does indicate there is a double-buffer problem in there somewhere though.
  
  Also, what GPU are you using?
