  @mfan and @u7angel since dx11 is not created by us, we don't own the redistribution and selling rights to it. hence we cannot include it in the official download which is sold under the vvvv licensing conditions.
  
  however, i think if @vux would request that we do so, it would be possible. but that needs to be discussed in more detail.
