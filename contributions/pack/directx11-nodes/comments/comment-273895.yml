  The Cylinder (DX11.Geometry) node is not acting how I expected; I thought it would follow the behavior of the Segment node, but it only sort of does.  When cycles is < 1 and > .5, it closes the edges instead of creating a wedge opening.  But when cycles is < .5, the caps form the expected segment, but the edges are directly closed to each other and do not follow the cap edges.
  
  I would expect the caps to follow the Segment behavior, and in all cases where Cycles is < 1, the cylinder faces follow the caps.  The current behavior just does not seem sensical.  This is with 38.1 and DX11 1.3.1.
