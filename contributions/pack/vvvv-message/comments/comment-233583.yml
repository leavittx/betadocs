  Yes, totally elegant solution.
  But when not using networking/osc and I only needed some custom datatypes to save myself from wiring loads of links through many levels of patches, woei's Struct seemed much simpler with less node overhead.
  
  I guess Message offers way more convenience and features that may be needed at times, but I sadly just didn't have the patience to wrap my mind around of it works, as it seemed to need way more nodes for a simple setup (Keep volatile Messages vs. permanent Structs).
  
  So, looking forward to learn more about this, pretty sure it solves other problems I have at times.
