  i'm failing in compiling the image-pack from source (using VS2012). 
  
  i'm getting lot's of these or similar errors
  ```
  Error	1	Unable to find version '31.3.2-develop-35' of package 'VVVV.Core'.	VVVV.CV.Core
  ```
  which indicates the wrong dependencies.
  nuget only installs current versions of these dependencies (i.e. 31.7.1-develop-171) and i have no clue where to get the older ones or update the pack to a newer version.
  any hints how to get this going? thanks
