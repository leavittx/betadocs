  That sounds neat.  Would love to see the finished patch if you get it up and running.
  
  I had a dx9 shader that I think is what you are asking for, here is a quick port to dx11 tfx.  
  
  Edit: can't upload here because it's a contribution thread but the code is very short:
  ****
  **SampleByTexture.tfx**
  ```
  Texture2D texture2d : PREVIOUS;
  Texture2D uvTex ;
  
  SamplerState linearSampler : IMMUTABLE
  {
      Filter = MIN_MAG_MIP_LINEAR;
      AddressU = Wrap;
      AddressV = Wrap;
  };
  
  struct psInput
  {
  	float4 p : SV_Position;
  	float2 uv : TEXCOORD0;
  };
  
  
  float4 PS(psInput input) : SV_Target
  {
  	float4 tUV = uvTex.Sample(linearSampler,input.uv);
  	float4 c = texture2d.Sample(linearSampler,tUV);
  	return c;
  }
  
  technique10 Process
  {
  	pass P0
  	{
  		SetPixelShader(CompileShader(ps_4_0,PS()));
  	}
  }
  
  ```
