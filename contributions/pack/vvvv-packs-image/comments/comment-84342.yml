  Hey Elliot Woods,
  
  what do you think about this? 
  
  ![screenshot](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/opencv-v4.png) 
  
  
  Any suggestions/ideas? 
  Assus XtionPro on win7(x64) with vvvv45beta27.2
  
  Note: I quickly checked the the openni parts of your code (on GitHub, there are some different repositories...), and I noticed that you init with 640x480@30fps, is that right or I'm completely wrong and should make myself another cup of coffee? 
  
  One more note: I did change the config xml to fit the Assus, still no result.
  
  
  P.S. Whatever the performance, how complicated is to have a node: AsCvImageLink (Texture), you know....
  
  Thanks ;)
