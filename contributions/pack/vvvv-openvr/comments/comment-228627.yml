  currently if you want more than phong shaded boxes, it won't be a smooth experience in vvvv now but it can be improved in the future with 2 things: waiting done at right time, and as vux suggested making a proper renderer for the compositor (instead of resource pointer readback as done currently which also consumes a lot of overhead)
