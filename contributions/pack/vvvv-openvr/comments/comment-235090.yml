  Nodes are missing for the Patch in VR patch, is this supposed to be working now? Or what are you using to do some patching while wearing the vr set? I tried with the camera but it is too low res, maybe screenshooting?

  EDIT: https://sourceforge.net/projects/screencapturer/files/ this one works at least so it is possible ot tweak the scene wearing the vrset.
  I am really missing a zoom feature here for vvvv though...
