  this pack is amazing, thanks for sharing! I've been using these nodes while prototyping my last project. i hooked up the vive with blender through osc using vvvv. for the final demo i turned towards unreal engine as the rendering features and accessibility were much more robust.

  moving on to my next project i was wondering wether this pack supports the htc vive tracker by any chance?
