  i'm using nvidia gforce 1060 everything was quite perfect before. 
  you are right the head rotation is quite smooth and no stutter in this case, but when moving ( walking or moving the controllers) the things are going worst. it seems to be a position refresh issue, like a delay between the real position of my controller and the position received by the computer. as the effect appears bigger when moving faster.
