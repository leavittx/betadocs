  hello 
  sry for delay too - but I was in wintersleep
  I tried your instructions, still weird but I see some improvements - I'll play with it again when I find some time and i'll report if I find an interesting patch behavior  
  now I need some time to start the new year  
  I send you how I produced the points - it's the contourPatch from the ImagePack
