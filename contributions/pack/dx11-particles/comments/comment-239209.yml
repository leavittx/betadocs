  @manuel:
  
  where did you get the particles pack from? latest github version? did you follow the installation instructions? did you download vvvv/dx11/dx11.particles in the same architecture? Please use TTY Renderer and paste error messages here.
  
  @guest:
  If you want to randomize it, you should use the mod-selector and play around with value + offset inputs.
  
  There is no lifespan in dx11.pointcloud. So you should use the particles pack for this kind of behaviour. In general I recommend not to use dx11.pointcloud anymore ;)
