  I was asked today if the nodes also work with more than 1 kinect. Yes it works ;)
  
  All you have to do is to use the Cons (DX11.Texture 2d) node and merge the depth/rgb/rgbdepth output of each kinect instance.
  You can then use the Validator (DX11.Layer) and GetSlice (DX11.Validator) nodes to filter the output layer of the Pointcloud node.
