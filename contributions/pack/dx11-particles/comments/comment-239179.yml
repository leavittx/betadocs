  Hey guys
  
  im getting some red nodes, coming from DX11.Extensions.dll
  I try to load the DLL on the vvvv patch to see if find the correct path, but only loads the filepath. it doesn't open the dialog to select which node u want to use from that DLL
  any hint?
  
  using win 10 64, vvvv 50beta35 clean with dx11 pack and dx11 particles
