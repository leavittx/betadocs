  Yes, ScaleFade and ColorFade were renamed in latest version on github.
  They are called ScaleByLifetime and ColorByLifetime now.
  
  Additionally there are new nodes called ScaleByDistance and ColorByDistance.
  
  Sorry for the circumstances! The pack has a versioninfo and a diffff.xml now, so this cannot happen anymore ;)
