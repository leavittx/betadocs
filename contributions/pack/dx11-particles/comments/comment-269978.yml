  yes it makes sense in your application and I recommend to save it as a custom modifier.
  
  but I think it doesn't make sense as part of the pack, since it breaks the default binsize/selection behaviour (if I get it right).
  
  if you want, you can send me the custom modifier, so I can have a look at it. maybe it makes sense after all :) and if not, I could add it to the examples.
