  Hello intolight team, and first of all thank you for this amazing work.
  
  I'm doing a new project in my university (merging pointclouds from multiple kinects and send it to Cinema4D), and now I'm searching for the right tools. 
  I'm trying Processing, brekel and vvvv... so I'm wondering if it's theoretically possible to merge multiple kinects through bouygroup?
  
  Like in your "MultipleKinectSetup" example, just on different mashines...   
  I'm new in vvvv, so I can't estimate if this is possible. 
  
  It would be great if you could give me some thoughts!!!
  
  
  Best regards
  neoshaman 
  
  edit: so it's for kinectV2
