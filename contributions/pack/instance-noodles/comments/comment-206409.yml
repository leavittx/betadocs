  for me the crash also occur on my laptop... 
  so gtx780ti or gtx970m
  
  the bug occur when you don't have a Geometry input feeding this chain
   
  1/ IID (instancer module)  
  2/ Gsfx without IID output like the VertexNoise (DX11.GeomFX) or DisplacmentMapping (DX11.GeomFX)
  3/a final Gsfx pass with IID input like TriFrame or PipeWire
  
  please see patch and report
