  @circuitb thanks for the tip.  I'd been using a max node to prevent a 0 being sent, but a nil would indeed pass through that.  I don't get it here, but it might be a card behavior difference.  Do you have that same behavior with all of the DX11.GeomFX in this pack?  will put the fix in all of them if so.
