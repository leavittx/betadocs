  @guest that should be fixed in next release.  What other modules are you talking about?  Kinect2GS is pretty much what you think it is I guess- get a mesh from your kinect2 textures.  Note there is a bug in current DX11 (also fixed for next release) that prevents gsfx from loading properly- in the mean time you might try reloading the patch after hooking it up.
