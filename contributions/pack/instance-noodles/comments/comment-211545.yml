  @io are you feeding it an empty buffer at the start?
  You can't use control point binsizing with that shader, you can make it but probably better off as a separate version.  If you have a look in the 'compute sources' girlpower you'll find one way of doing it (you'll still need to modify the hlsl quite a bit though).
