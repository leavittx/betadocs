  @guest I didn't check your patch, but it's a known issue.  It's basically because it's using a single up-vector, so that can cause the resulting transform to flip in some cases.
  
  I heard (maybe from @Pedro?) that you can detect and correct for this.  Not sure of the matrix math for that though.  Happy to implement it if someone knows how that should work.
