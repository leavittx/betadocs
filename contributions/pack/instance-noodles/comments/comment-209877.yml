  ##  New Nodes
  
  **Geometry**
  * Kinect2Face (DX11.Geometry)module wrapping HDFace
  * Writer (DX11.Geometry OBJ) obj writer with instance ID to mesh subset support
  * Merge (DX11.GeomFX)flatten cpu transforms to a single mesh, or multiple instance batches to a single one
  * PN_Tesselator (DX11.GeomFX)smooth tessellation
  
  +some nice deformers, thanks to UNC for smooth normals trick.
  * Deformer (DX11.GeomFX) 
  * SurfaceDistortions (DX11.GeomFX)
  * Wobble (DX11.GeomFX)
  
  **Compute**
  * Transpose (Transform Buffer)
  * SwapDim (2D Buffer)
  * SwapDim (3D Buffer)
  
  **Layer**
  * GouraudDirectionalBuffered (DX11.Layer)

  ##  Changed /fixed Nodes
  
  * IID (DX11.GeomFX)  fixed nasty crashing bug on changing to nil geom.  Now reverts to a box now when there is no geometry to instance.
  * SplineBuffered (DX11.Geometry) now supports radius per control point as well as per spline
  * Removed uv passthrough  in UV_Coords (DX11.GeomFX) to allow geometry with no uv.  Did some fixes to uv modes and moved them to modules\Common\UV.fxh   Added UV mode options to control maps for Triframe, CutTriangle & Extrude.
  * BuildTextureArray (DX11.TextureFX) fixed reverse ordering of textures bug
  * Cross (3D Buffer) fixed disconnected  link
