  @microdee haven't been able to replicate, you wouldn't happen to have gsfx files of the same name already elsewhere would you?  And you are right of course about proper pack structure, I did it a bit different as I don't want all of these fx files coming up in my nodelist when they are mostly just meant for use in their companion module.  Only checked the one you mentioned though.
