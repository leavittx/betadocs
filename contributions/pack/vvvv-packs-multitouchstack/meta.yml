  This is a rewrite of the MultiTouch Stack nodes mentioned here:
  * https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/multitouch-stack/4924
  * [multitouch-stack-revived](xref:contribution/multitouch-stack-revived)
  
  The rewrite brings the following functions:
  
  * Help patches
  * Custom hit functions (e.g. image mask, transform, shapes)
  * Custom hit events for any hit function (get an event callback when a custom area of a slide is hit, e.g. buttons on slides)
  * Filter nodes
  * Preview (DX11) for easy debugging
  * TouchSimulator (thanks to xdnitro)
  * Object Oriented everything
  
  Since 2019-02-15
  
  * Fallback Behaviours and Constraints (e.g. fall back to Translate if you rotate a Slide into a Constraint)
  * DX9 help patches (thanks to Simon H!)
  
  Thanks to Luma (xdnitro) for funding development.
  
  The nodes are open source (https://github.com/elliotwoods/VVVV.Nodes.MultiTouchStack) and should run on AnyCPU.
