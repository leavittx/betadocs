  Yo md! Thanks for this release :)
  
  Seems there's something wrong during installation : all packs install successfully (mp.dx, mp.essentials, mp.fxh) but FBX4V isn't there. Prompt says :
  
  ```
  Installing FBX4V
  
  Data :
  
  VVVV Architecture seems to be x64
  Removing vpm temp folder
  All good in theory.
  Enjoy!
  ```
  
  Also, VPM tells me that Message is already installed, but it doesn't seem to see I also already have dx11, and downloads it anyway.
  
  Any clue?
  Thanks!
