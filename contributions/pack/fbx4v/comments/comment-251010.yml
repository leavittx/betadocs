  well well, i have another question:
  
  as you can see at the attached pic, i have some missing folder, i dunno what the missing nodes are doing? but, since i still dont have the patch running i asking step by step..
  
  **do you know where the folder is located or how i can replace the red shader-node.**
  
  thank you for the patience.
  
  if i ever got this running (and its good) i promise i write a sall tutorial of how to get it running :)
