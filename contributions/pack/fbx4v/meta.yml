  1.  FBX4V
  
  is an advanced FBX importer using the official Autodesk FBX SDK 2018. It might be a better choice instead of the Assimp importer if you want to use a feature specific to FBX like:
  * Embedded media
  * Blendshapes
  * Triangulating NURBS, or higher order faces than triangles
  * Using multiple UV layers
  * Handling node transformation hierarchy properly
  * Instantly use rigged meshes (skeletal animation) coming right from the main SkeletalMesh node
  * Having a more shader oriented pipeline
  
  ##  Installation:
  
  If you haven't already, Get [vpm](xref:contribution/vpm)
  ###  <a href="vpms://raw.githubusercontent.com/vvvvpm/vpdb/master/microdee/FBX4V/17.08.15.vpack">Install via vpm</a>
  
  Read the EULA and on the bottom you'll find a toggle button for assets.

  ##  Known issues:
  
  Consult girlpower.v4p for known issues
  
  ##  License:
  
  It had a non-commercial but then the whole thing broke and doesn't work. FBX4V will be merged into mp.dx soon which means it'll be under MIT license from that moment.
  
  Enjoy!
