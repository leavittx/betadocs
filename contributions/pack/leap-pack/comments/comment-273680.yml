  I clone the SSD of my laptop where Leap(Device)VL work fine with Orion 4 and Vvvv 38.1 x64.
  I put the SSD on my PC wich is a Xeon but Leap is not working, not connected.
  Can you help me to understand from where can come the problem ?
  The Unity visualizer is still working perfectly.
  
  Thanks,
