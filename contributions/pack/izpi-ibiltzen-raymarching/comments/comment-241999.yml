  The documentation or, better, an actual "cheat sheet" of all functions available to you in this "framework" is missing still and so I will design it and update soon. For now, look in "usefulFunctions.fxh" to see what is available to you. Also, most things are covered in girlpower and in this Inigo Quilez page: http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm
  That IQ page is kinda your cheat sheet for now, cheers broskis.
