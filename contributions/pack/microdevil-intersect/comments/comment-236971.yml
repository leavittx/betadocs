  Yo mr boni,
  
  I'm not seeing a goat on your boat, bro, but the ticket has been logged.
  
  Firstly regarding install yes, indeed, this is a pack plugin and it must be put in "packs" to work (that was explained in the description text already albeit lost in pseudo-humorous mumbo-jumbo) I will make it more clear by having it in CAPS...
  
  I made a sort of triple-patch-help-patch which in hindsight is a stupid fucking idea as i think the mouse nodes are confusing the shit outta eachother, i will fix a more robust help patch with only one patch and still three stand alone examples in girlpowr folder (don't forget you can do 2d touch/ mouse and ui collision detection with this shit)
  
  Spreading ray input bug: Will look into it, this plugin will be updated today or tomorrow. cheers broh
