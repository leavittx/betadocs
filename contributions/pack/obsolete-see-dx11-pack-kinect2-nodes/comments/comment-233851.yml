  I made small modifications to the current Kinect2 DX11 nodes so they work with unplugged device and playback from Kinect Studio. I know some of you guys faced this issue before (@everyoneishappy, @princemio, @timpernagel)
  
  Switching between live stream and injected stream got more robust as a side-effect. Now there is no need to reset the Kinect2 node when connecting/disconnecting Kinect Studio.
  
  I've made a pull request toward DX11 master from Mr. Vux. Meanwhile download to nodes

  (replace the .dll in your dx11 pack)
  
  or compile yourself from my forked repo
