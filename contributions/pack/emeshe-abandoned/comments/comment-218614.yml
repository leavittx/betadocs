  it should work with latest contrib dx11 but if it doesn't then:
  
  clone / zip download https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv, clone / zip download dx11 submodules (feraltic and girlpower), download VS 2013 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532495&clcid=0x409 community, install it (it can take a while) open dx11 solution, set desired architecture (x86/x64) under Build -> Build Configuration, also set "Release" mode then Build -> Build Solution, in file explorer navigate to %dx11 source folder%\Deploy\Release\x64\packs and copy dx11 folder to your vvvv packs.
