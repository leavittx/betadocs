  thank you for the enormous work md!
  one think i want to know - which shadow filtering algorithm are you using - is it VSM or another one?
  i'm going to take the shadows alone and optimize them, and hope to make separate contribution, it may be very useful. any advice for optimizing?
  
  @matka: from time to time i have my laptop frozen because of preview(dx11.texture).
  maybe same at yours
