  @microdee,thank you,  I think I will check out the UE4 plugin. I've been using UE4 a bit and its pretty fun. UE4 also has integration with fabric engine, so if I could harness the combined power of Fabric (super fast 3D operations), vvvv (interoperability) and UE4 (rendering), that would be pretty awesome.
  
  In the meantime I found some nice DX11 DOF and SSAO in the contributions, that I finally got working after some tinkering. Combined with Superphong it looks pretty good in 4K on a 55" LCD and super smooth with a few hundred instances.
