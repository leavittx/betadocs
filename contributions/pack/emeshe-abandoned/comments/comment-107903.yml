  @ain: well the shadow "softening" is really simple: lookup the shadowmap from different directions and then blend them together. separate directions are generated based on a dynamicbuffer sample offset. also the shadows are not really correct because for avoiding artifacts i needed to implement a "transition" between not shaded and fully shaded based on the difference between the shadowmap position and the actual position
