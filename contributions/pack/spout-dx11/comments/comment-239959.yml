  unfortunately on both ue4 and resolume the spout receivers are limited to 10 entries by default !
  should be modified in ue4 with #define MaxSenders in the plugin : https://github.com/AleDel/Spout-UE4/blob/6957020c08fc622ce0e822a712b0fd6bd18ee952/ThirdParty/Spout/include/SpoutSenderNames.h
  
  works great in vvvv with the latest alpha
  thx
