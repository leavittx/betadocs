  * It gives you 2 prototypes (rectangle and ellipse) and a way to create **your own polygons**.
  * It has tools to **analyse**polygons (area and bounds)
  * It comes with all the **typical nodes** you need to build applications (getslice, select, group, change, queue, s+h)
  * It has **boolean operations** to merge and mangle polygons.
  * It has helper modules to transform polygons into **Layers** and **Meshes**.
  * It has 3 kinds of **hittests**.
  * It has extensive **helpfiles**.
  * 
  * It is **fully**spreadable.
  * It is **fast**as lightning.
  * It is **open**and **free**.
