  It is possible, if you are using VST instruments inside VVVV.
  
  There are many VST's for synthesis, probably you know but I drop anyway that link: https://www.kvraudio.com/plugins/windows/macosx/vst-plugins/vst3-plugins/audio-units/aax-plugins/rack-extensions/instruments/free/most-popular
  
  For payed version, personally i am a fan of the VSTs from Madrona Labs for more unique sounds with accoustic envelope models
  https://madronalabs.com/
  and DUNE 2 for the more drony / fat sounds https://www.synapse-audio.com/dune2.html
  
  On the pure VVVV side you can check out the Wavetable example in this pack, here you can make sounds with spreads, which is also very unique.
