Here they are (again) Box2D nodes.

Now available as a separate pack, with 32 and 64 bits version.

Other changes from previous addonpack versions:

GetBodyDetails, GetCircles and GetPolygons are now faster, and have less GC pressure

Please note this is now installed as a standard pack.

Works with either beta 33.7, or beta 35+ (does not work with beta 34 series).
