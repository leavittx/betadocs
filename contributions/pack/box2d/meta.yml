  Here they are (again) Box2D nodes.
  
  Now available as a separate pack, with 32 and 64 bits version.
  
  Other changes from previous addonpack versions:
  
  GetBodyDetails, GetCircles and GetPolygons are now faster, and have less GC pressure
  
  Please note this is now installed as a standard pack.
  
  Works with either beta 33.7, or beta 35+ (does not work with beta 34 series).
