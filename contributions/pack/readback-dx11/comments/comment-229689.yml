  Hi Elliot,
  
  Is it possible to specify to save a singlechannel R16_UNorm .dds ? 
  
  When I specify the target format (R16_UNorm) of the renderer before it goes to the ReadBack writer (DX11.Texture2D Async), select format Dds for the writer, and make sure the filename is .dds; when I read the image sequence, the image is a 
  
  R16G16B16A16_UNorm file
  
  Thank you for the great work ! 
  
  Lasse :)
