  hey julius,
  
  assuming you have the pleora ebus sdk installed, seems like it might be looking for a very specific version of the dll... 
  "Version=4.0.5.3150" maybe you can contact pleora about it?! 
  Im afraid I wont be able to help you debug it further than that, as I have no access to the source atm...
