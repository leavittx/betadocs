The Dictionary plugin implements the c# dictionary function as a node.
You can store spreads assigned to an ID (Key), and read from the dictionary by IDs (Keys).
It is useful for working with changing spreads, where you want to add / remove specific slices, instead of just adding or removing slices from the end.
