  There we go again this year, some little gifts for the community. I split it in two parts this year, so for christmas here are a few Toys until new year and a bit fat baby is coming.
  
  Provided as lat year in two zips, one as a flat folder (all files in the same folder, and one as one folder per dll file for advanced users).
  
  So what do we have this year?
  * Bin sized version for InputMorph/MultiFlipFlop/Sort
  * Some more file nodes, Writer (File Advanced), and good old SequentialReader is back there (and will be in next addon pack)
  * LTP Value for having multiple inputs sources, with takeover mode Ableton style.
  * Switch Transform with spreadable switch input, and * Transform with priority pin, to change transform order on the fly.
  * OccurenceFilter and Stacks nodes
  * And one little fatty Advanced Sequencer (Courtesy of Eno who funded the devvvv for this Plugin). Would almost need a user guide for this one So i let you discover :)
  
  Enjoy your Christmas!
