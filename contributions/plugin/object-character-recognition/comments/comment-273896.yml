  @dEp , have you tried the 32bit version of vvvv ? not sure which lib version i used here. and it is really just a simple code example. just check it out. if it doesnâ€˜t work, its most likely a library problem aka dependency.
  
  i would not spend to much time with this because the results are mediocre. makes more sense to look for a better solution.
