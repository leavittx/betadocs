  I get a red node on loop point, and corresponding mainloop hicup, has anyone else seen this?
  
  
  05:15:19 ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate
  05:15:19 ERR : Index was outside the bounds of the array.
  05:15:19 ERR : System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException in mscorlib: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.
  Parameter name: index
  
  Stacktrace:
     at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException(ExceptionArgument argument, ExceptionResource resource)
     at VVVV.DX11.PlayerDX11Node.Update(DX11RenderContext context)
  
  so it seems that any value below 1 s on the doseek time or the start time of the loop does this
