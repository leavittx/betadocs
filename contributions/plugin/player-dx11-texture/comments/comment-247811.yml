  No, it never freed those gigs until vvvv.exe was terminated.
  Disabling the Player only stopped it from eating even more (with the Play toggle, or the modules Evaluate). 
  
  The use case was displaying up to 16 image sequences in parallel, images were around 320x240 or something. 
  Customer provided jpg, which obviously didn't help the io performance either.
  
  I admit freely, the general setup was not ideal and bound to lag with a hdd. However, IO can always be diminished (involuntary windows update download, anyone?) and frame drops should be handled gracefully.
