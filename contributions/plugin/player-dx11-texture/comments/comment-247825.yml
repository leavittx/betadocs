  To overcharge the plugin and cause the mem leak (and the Exception) should be a piece of cake with any jpg sequence running in a loop. 
  Sorry that I don't have the time to fix the node, but if you have some thing I can test, just holler.
  
  About your other thoughts, I guess, it depends on how you define crucial. In my case I was lucky to have found it and worked around the issue. 
  Other people might not be so lucky (or thorough), and let is slip, because "everything works smoothly", and get wrecked completely, once a little io stutter happens for some time. 
  
  So I guess I'll just leave this warning here: In professional environments such as long-term museum installations or mission-critical event patches Player should be used only with utmost care, because even a temporary IO lag could cause the plugin to crash vvvv.
