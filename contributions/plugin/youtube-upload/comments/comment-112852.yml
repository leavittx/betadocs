  hi,
  
  "Unlisted" and new functionalities come with the Google.Apis.YouTube.v3
  using Oauth 2.0 (with Client ID, Client Secret...)
  
  Console Application sample here: 
   
  https://github.com/youtube/api-samples/tree/master/dotnet
  
  tested and works fine after updating  the Microsoft.Bcl nuget 
  but not the skills to port this to vvvv
