  @[motzi](http://vvvv.org/users/motzi) oh, sorry, I instinctively assumed it was a pack since I don't use the contribs folder that much.
  
  I don't know if it would make more sense as a pack... there seems to be quite a large amount of nodes and some cool examples that could fit in a \girlpower folder, I guess that's why it felt like a pack to me rather than a simple plugin contrib.
