  @dr_quatz : sorry for replying late  - no socks5 for now, that's not implemented
  
  @guest: are you running an alpha version of VVVV? in betas exceptions should not block the running patch. or you can start an alpha via commandline parameter /showexceptions false (see here [commandline parameters](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/commandline.html)). does this help?
