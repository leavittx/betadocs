  With the rise of messenger apps it appears that chatbots are becoming (again) a user interface for almost anything.
  
  Now, thanks to the awesome [Bot-API](https://core.telegram.org/bots) which is offered by the cloud based [Telegram messenger service](https://telegram.org/) and the [Telegram.Bot C# API](https://github.com/TelegramBots/telegram.bot), you can now build your own Telegram chatbots within VVVV using these plugins.
  
  ###  Why should I care? 
  
  Well, messenger apps are super simple to use and offer quite easy options to capture and send/receive media. By building a chatbot within VVVV you can easily get data in and out from your patches using your mobile phone or whatever Telegram client you are using.
  One can think of many applications where a chatbot could be of great use:
  * A notification service (let your patches talk to you, send you photos, sounds, documents, ...)
  * An advanced remote control (send data into your patch from wherever you are)
  * An easy way to write text or upload media to your patches by anyone (i.e. take a photo in the Telegram client, press send, get the result almost immediately as a texture in your running patch).
  * and many more...
  
  Nothing new, to be honest, but the simplicity of the interface of a chatbot is just striking.
  
  ### What does vvvv-Telegram offer? 
  
  * Nodes to send and receive messages for text, locations, venues, contacts, photos, stickers, videos, audio, voice-recordings and documents from VVVV to Telegram clients (and vice versa).
  * Create custom keyboards (Reply and Inline keyboards)
  * Receive callbacks from Inline Keyboards and send notifications
  
  #### Not there (yet):
  
  * Inline Bots
  * private mode
  * Game messages
  * ...
  
  All web operations (connect, send, receive) happen asyncronously and most nodes are spreadable with regard to the BotClients.
  
  ### How to use
  
  * Get yourself a [Telegram client](https://telegram.org/) (e.g. app on your smartphone)
  * Talk to the botfather to [create a telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
  ** You will receive an API-Key that will allow your bot to connect to Telegram
  * Use the API-Key on the <span class="node">BotClient</span> node to be able to connect
  * Connect Send/Receive message nodes to the botclient for being able to talk to the bot.
  
  Have a look at the patches inside for more details.
  
  ### Sources
  
  https://github.com/mhusinsky/vvvv-Telegram
  
  ### Releases
  
  * v0.2.1: no changes, just the dll assembly version number got bumped to 0.2
  * v0.2: Long overdue update. No big changes, it just works again. It now uses the latest Telegram.Bot libraries (version 15.5.1) that made some changes necessary. Plugin was tested with b37-b39, hope I did not miss any bugs.
  * v0.1: Initial Release. Note: The Telegram.Bot.dll used for this contains a minor bugfix for venue messages that is not yet in the Telegram.Bot core ([pull request pending](https://github.com/TelegramBots/telegram.bot/pull/277)).
  
  ###  Important note:
  
  Telegram.Bot uses Newtonsoft.JSON in version 9 (vvvv-telegram 0.1) and version 11.0.2 (vvvv-telegram 0.2). As some other plugins/packs also use this library (e.g. vvvv-Message, vvvv-Time, ...) there might be dll conflicts resulting in exceptions during use. Be sure to scan your repositories and packs for this dll and remove the older versions. Sorry for this, [but it seems there is no other way...](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/how-to-deal-with-different-versions-of-same-dll/14330)
