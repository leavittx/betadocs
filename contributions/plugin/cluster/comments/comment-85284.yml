  Unless I misunderstand what the output pins are, "Members" is listing the cluster number that each X & Y input slice belongs to, correct?
  
  But I'm seeing numbers in the "Members" output pin that are not in the "ID" output pin list.  There's not even a very good overlap; for example, "Members" may contain 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, but "ID" only contains 4 slices of 0, 1, 2, 3.  Note this is with constant input data so nothing is changing with time.
  
  How do these pins correspond to each other?  What does the "Members" data mean?  I had hoped to be able to use that pin to group corresponding Z data, but no joy.  Thanks!
