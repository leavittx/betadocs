  hi , so i cant get it to work the easy way 
  could someone post the simple way to add plugin cause my workaround is a nightmare 
  
   my way of doing it 
  
  make a contributions folder with 3 subfolder named effect plugin and modules
  right click on the Root node ans open as root 
  select my contribution folder and save the root 
  
  now i get to use this node if and only if the Root node is open first prior to VVVV 
  if not , the node doesnt exist and cant be loaded 
  
  i am sure there has to be an easier way to do it ?
