  Ahoi tf & gregsn,
  
  I'm fondly using FDG for a current thesis work, here's a wish list:
  - clicking a node in the graph extends/shows subsequent links
  - a spreadable third InputPin next to "From" and "To" to specify individual colours for the nodes in the graph
  - setting the size of a node in the graph, relative to the number of subsequent links
  
  Any chance of an updated version?
