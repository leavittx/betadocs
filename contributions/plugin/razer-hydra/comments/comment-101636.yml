  Oh, and there is a great modification of the original Oculus Tuscany demo by the makers of the Hydra, Sixense:
  
  http://sixense.com/sixensetuscanydemo
  (you don't need an Oculus Rift for it - it is already great with just a Hydra, but using the Oculus makes it even more immersive)
  
  If you have the chance, try that. It greatly shows that camera-based tracking methods aren't about to beat other methods. In this demo, you can throw stuff over your head, catch objects behind your back, grab things lying on the floor, bounce a basketball...
