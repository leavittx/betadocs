  @idwyr cool!!! please do so...maybe we can have an advanced texture fx that has all the necessary FX in it...Roughly guessed my antenna seems to have about 12 different versions which happily destroy my girls Greys anatomy. Especially in summer. lol.
  
  The Filter here is now at 5. 
  As you see the current filter FX do a lot with Color and pixel shifting.
  
  Additionally it would be cool to generate noised or randomized pixel sets which flood the image like that:

  So if anyone has an idea how to flood an image in a noisy way that still relates to the original - please try
  
  
  
  thank you
