  hi,
  
  regarding pdfsharp:
  the latest version 
  Can create PDF files marked for PDF version 1.2 (Adobe Acrobat Reader 3) through 1.7 (Adobe Reader 8);
  
  Supports PDF versions 1.2 through 1.4 (including the transparency features introduced with Adobe Reader 5.0); these files can be read and written
  
  theres's a workaround with itextsharp to convert unreadables pdf's 
  but it's is not free
