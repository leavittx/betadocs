  I think this contribute is outdated or only works with an older versions of vvvv and dx11pack (don't know which one)
  
  but if it is for business: 
  NSYNK are selling "DX11 BlackmagicDesign Decklink VideoIn" nodes in the store - [/store](https://store.vvvv.org/) and they usually have the good shit ;)for production. 
  
  There is also a SpoutWay:

  https://magicmusicvisuals.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=201 
  
  for the hardcore stuff - NSYNK
  for dailybread - BlackSpout 
  
  just my advice
