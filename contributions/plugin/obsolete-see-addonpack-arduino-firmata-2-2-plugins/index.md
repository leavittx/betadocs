The all new Firmata Plugins to encode and decode the recent Firmata 2.2 protocol.

The advantage of two plugins: the protocol can be used with all sorts of devices/interfaces. And since there is no direct dependency on hardware, error diagnosis is far easier.

**Check out the Subpatch coming with this release!**

The plugins should work out-of-the-box with Arduino UNO. If you need **more inputs/outputs** (eg. Arduino Mega)check the inspector for hidden settings and modify the subpatch.

This is the beta test on contributions before it replaces the old ArduinoFirmata plugin (addon pack).
