  Just tested the new plugin with a button, a LED and a servo motor (all running simultaneously) under vvvv beta 27.1 with an arduino UNO and the StandartFirmata of the Arduino IDE 1.0.
  
  Worked like a charm.
  
  Hopefully IÂ´ll find some time later this week to check it under Parallels as well as under Bootcamp since I just had a native Windows laptop at hand.
  
  Great work guys and thanks for this all new ArduinoFirmata-Update!
