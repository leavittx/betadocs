  @kopffarben: yep, i know.
  however numerics apply those instruction on vectors. which in this case is maximum 3. i do that on iteration which maxes to 8.
  the cost of this algorithm is not really complicated arithmetics but just running a lot of loops over a lot of arrays. thus unmanaged outperformes .net quite a bit, since there is no boundschecking on array access.
  cli would of course also optimize into simd instructions, but only for cases where you exactly loop from 0 to length-1 of the array. and that is nearly never the case here, due to special boundary conditions in the algorithm.
  
  i've also got the same implementation in c# with all the performance optimizations i could think of. still didn't get near the speed of c++
