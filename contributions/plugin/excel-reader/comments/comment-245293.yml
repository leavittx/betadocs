  hello :) I use
  
  Windows 8.1. 64bit
  Microsoft Office 2016 
  vvvv_50beta35.5_x64
  excel reader is installed at E:\vvvv_50beta35.5_x64\packs\excel\nodes\plugins
  
  Excel import is running, even without pia.exe installed, but vvvv gets slow when toggeling read (=program freeze for about 2 seconds)
  
  now I checked the link in the help patch but have no clue what to do with the files:
  - after downloading and running PIARedist.exe I got the o2010pia.msi ? now?
  - Do I have to move the .dlls somewhere else?
  
  
  
  after parsing/reading the program runs smoothly and I also can change my data selection. great!
