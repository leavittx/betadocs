  Hi, 
  
  Thank you for a great looking contribution! 
  
  I'm just having an issue getting the Kinect examples to run. 
  
  The 'configuration' node error was fixed by dragging the kinect.dll onto _root.v4p - however am still showing a red node with 'users', 'rgb', 'depth', and 'text'. 
  
  I am really keen to get this up and running as see lots of great possibilities.  
  
  Maybe I should use an earlier version of VVVV(?)
  
  Any help would be much appreciated...... 
  
  Please see the screenshot for clarification:
