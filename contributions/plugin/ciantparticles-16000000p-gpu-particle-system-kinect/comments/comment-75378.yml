  I am having problems with the kinect part. The RGB and Depth Node are red but it dosent say anything about missing .dll.
  I am not into the world og programming. Only started with vvvv for a couple of months ago so any help would be appriciated.
  
  Primsense drivers are up and running and the kinect works great with  Kinect_OpenNI_Library_1.2.
  
  Tnx for a facinating program and contributions =)
