  Thanks for great contribution!
  
  I cannot see strawman, too. looks graphic card freezing!
  Win7, 64bit, GTX 460.
  
  (update)
  OnlyAnimatedPs and OnlyFire works fine.
  But OnlyGeometry same problem...
  
  Windows ActionCenter reports "video hardware trouble" and
  "LiveKernelEvent" is event name. helpful?
