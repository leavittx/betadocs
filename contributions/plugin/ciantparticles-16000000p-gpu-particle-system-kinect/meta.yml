  ##  Ciant Particles
  
  is a particle system on GPU. 
  
  With a number of applied forces it can operate millions of particles. You can take vertices of a mesh as an input for particle positions, describe their movement with a number of parameters, combine them with geometry and other objects and create beautiful spectacular real-time effects. You can connect this particle system to Kinect, sound input or usb camera. See how, in a tutorial. Possibilities are really wide.
  
  To create a particle system:
  1.  Set input positions for particles (patch CiantCreatePositionsTexture)
  1.  Set parameters and forces for particles (size, color, texture, ...)
  1.  CiantParticles outputs a layer .. render it!
  Every step is described in the tutorial.
  
  The particle system is my dissertation. So if you try it, use it, or make some performances, tell me. Post pictures here, or send me an email: apu@email.cz 
  There are many ways the particle system could be improved, many bugs that need to be slapped. We can cooperate on that. Documentation is inside.
  
  I am still working to improve the particle system. 
  
  
  Big thanks to 
  [hiero](http://vvvv.org/users/hiero), [phlegma](http://vvvv.org/users/phlegma) and all the creators of OpenNI Plugin - I used it.
  Matthias Zauner [sagishi](http://vvvv.org/users/sagishi) and his diploma Character Animation in vvvv - I used it.
