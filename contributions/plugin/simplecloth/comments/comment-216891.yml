  Hi woei,
  thanks for contribution! very nice!
  Is there a way to archive that deformed grid persists its changes?
  Like with "normal" mesh to write changed position values in Buffer (Spreads) and over FrameDelay build new mesh. 
  I don't get how I can insert new position values somewhere before Attractor (Cloth). We have Split but no Joint (Cloth) to modify VertexBuffer.
  Thanks, Dimi
