  I was finding printing plugin for using Thermal Printer.
  My Thermal Printer driver is well-installed in my windows 7.
  Thermal Printer is working well in Notepad and Window Paint and so on.
  In winows 7, It is recognized as a normal printer, and default printer.
  but using this plugin in vvvv, only right black line is printed.
  In Print HelpPatch, I also tried changing to various image texture, but result is only right black line, nothing different exist.
  
  another odd thing is,
  In Print HelpPatch, AsString(EX9. Texture)'s File Format InputPin seems available only PNG.
  if I select BMP, it doesn't print.
  In console window, this message is shown "Can not load image data: The parameter is incorrect."
  
  I am using vvvv29beta30 x86, win7 x64 ultimate, mc374kh/a.
  could you help me?
