  works quite well with piano and I can imagine it being a fun addition to standard vj sound analysis. nice one!
  
  it should not zero back to c-1 while it is not detecting anything though. a bang if something got recognized would be handy. btw, I would recommend githubbing the source, if you want people to help with Future plans
