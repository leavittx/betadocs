  I think it should work , but the problem will be that you'll have to change the other node to have json input spreadable as well , add a binsyze for the query node otherwise there will be no way to know wich query go with wich json.
  Actually an easier way will be to add all the json together with +(string spectral) node with the correct json formatting and query it as a single json , much more easy than dealing with binsyze stuff and at the end you got the same result.
  The node for the list is also not spreadable , but could be without to much work , as well a binsyze output will be needed to identify the ouput data with the corresponding query.
  
  Usually when i don't have time, i don't care about doing stuff i don't need , but i still share the result...
