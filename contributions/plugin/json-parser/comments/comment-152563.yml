  [sanch](http://vvvv.org/users/sanch), hi
  I used this plugin very usefully.
  but, I have a trouble in parse of using JSON Array node.
  {key1 : <{key2:value2},%20{key3:value3},%20{key4:value4}> }
  this data could parse successfully.
  but this data couldn't in case of just only json array except of key.
  <{key2:value2},%20{key3:value3},%20{key4:value4}>
  maybe, I think JSON Array node always need path value.
