  [mino](http://vvvv.org/users/mino) - are you still developing this? I tried getting it to work with 35.2, but keep getting this error:
  
  ```
  
  Exception occurred during creation of plugin: Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\Program Files\vvvv_50beta35.2_x64 SP 1.1\vvvvContributions\plugins\AntTweakBar_1.0\AntTweakBarNode.dll' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.
  
  ```
  
  Any idea why that might be? Have done all the unblocking and files are in the location it is looking for.
