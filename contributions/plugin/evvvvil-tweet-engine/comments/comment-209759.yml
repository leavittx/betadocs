  lovely work [evvvvil](http://vvvv.org/users/evvvvil), thanks'n'kisses 
  
  did run into some problems though, 
  
  I often get no search results. engine starts searching but that's about it.
  Sometimes a restart of vvvv helps, sometimes rebooting helps, sometimes not even that for a couple of minutes. 
  
  If I try to search again, it keeps shouting at me to "Chill out bro it's already searching".
  You did build in the new cancel search bang for that, but it doesnt, whatever I do to it, press it, shake it, squeeze it. Keeps telling me to "chill..."
  Need to restart then. But often still get no search results.
  
  (win7, vvvv_45beta34.1_x64)
  
  And finally after not washing my nicely curled mullet for a month - I love the naturally greesy style - I started to get itchy dendruff.
  
  Anything you can do about that? Workarounds? Cheers m8
