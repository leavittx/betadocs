Heyho,

here's a pretty much complete plugin for Intel's "Intel Perceptual Computing SDK" ([here](http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/perceptual-computing-sdk)).

It works with two cameras:
Softkinetic DS325
Creative Interactive Gesture Camera
(the two are the same device in different housings...)

You need to install the Intel PCSDK from above URL.

Note: Currently, the Intel PCSDK (and thus this plugin) does not support 
multiple cameras.

2012-11-15: Initial release. Proudly presented by MESO.

2013-01-30: Changed to beta 2.

2013-05-07: Changed to release version of PCSDK. Added support for voice recognition.
