  That's strange. It's hit and miss now, it was working well before but now works sometimes and other times not working. I've got the vvvv_45beta28.1 folder installed in c:/Program Files(86)/vvvv_45beta28.1
  
  I noticed it's working when I start vvvv.exe first and then click on one of the 02_PCSDK DS325.zip patches. it needs work but it's a good start.![](https://vvvv.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large/images/GeoNode%20%28Devices%20DS325%29%20help_2012.12.08-00.15.09.png)
