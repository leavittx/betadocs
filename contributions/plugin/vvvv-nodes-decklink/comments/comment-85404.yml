  Hi,
  I have an intensity shuttle.
  I am pretty new to vvvv....
  The shuttle is recognised and works with media express.
  The "list devices" node recognises the shuttle.
  Bust the status says "no device conected".
  The shuttle works with the classic videoin node, but not with the decklink node. I am very interested in the "low latency" point as I work for theatre and try to be as close as possible to lipsync.
  Some help would be great, I'm sorry for not being able to give more constructive details
  Thanx
  Mehdi
