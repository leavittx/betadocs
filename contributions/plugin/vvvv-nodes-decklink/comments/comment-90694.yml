  got the intensity pro today and it works nearly perfect with my canon eos 7d. thank you elliot!
  
  first i got a white screen out of the texture-fx, so i switched the texture format to 'No Specific' at it works.
  
  if i turn the camera on foto-mode, the quality (iso-noise, resolution and interlacing (in fullscreen)) is much better than in video mode! but i think it even increase the latency by a few frames. 
  
  any idea to avoid the interlaced-issue at all?
  
  also nice would be a info about the framerate.
  
  next quest: get magic lantern to run. <http://tiny.cc/kyv5mw>
