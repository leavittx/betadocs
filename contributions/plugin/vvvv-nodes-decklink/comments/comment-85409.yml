  The 1 frame latency is from a BlackMagic technician I spoke to about 3 years ago regarding the internal Intensity Pro product. When doing the PC A to PC B test then there's 3 more stages the image must go through before being presented on monitor B:
  
  #Capture from card into app (this is the 1 frame latency quoted by BlackMagic)
  1. Wait for render frame (the video frame arriving whilst a render frame is being produced will generally need to wait for the next render frame before being presented to the screen)
  1. Render from app to GPU out (1 frame latency)
  1. Latency of second monitor (generally 10ms for a modern fast monitor)
  
  We negate step 4, presuming monitor A has the same latency
  
  Step 2 could be marginally improved by forcing each render to wait until a new frame arrives from the capture device. This would lower framerate of course, but improve latency by approximately 50% of a render frame.
  
  I've perhaps been overstating the latency ability of this capture route and haven't done as much serious testing as reading this contribution might imply. I'm mostly comparing it to a DirectShow approach. I've added your notes to the description.
