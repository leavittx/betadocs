Before some months I was working and playing around with MySQL via vvvv. My purpose was to use different parts from the Bible (greek polytonic version). It was realy a pain in the ass. So I ended up with one combination of different nodes (encoding and decoding) and with this plugin that I am providing here. Hopw it helps. Please try and improve if you like !

cheers
