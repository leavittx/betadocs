  Yes only depth/color is supported, but should be possible (despite fact have only one kinect right now at home, should quite work).
  
  Skeleton only possible in one kinect at a time so far (heard can be done if you run 2 processes in the same machine, havent tried tho).
  
  I'll check skelly bit today (btw all apart from mesh loader on github now).
