  I can confirm depth and color works with 2 kinects. You can (sorta) get skeleton data from the first kinect when using 2, but the data is not as smooth, very laggy. Depth is fine on both tho. 
  
  Either way, if using skeleton data, set it to depthOnly. DepthAndPlayer makes the skeleton weird even with one kinect enabled.

  Edit:
  
  Got 2 kinects with full skeleton functionality working by running 2 instances of 4v. Woot. Hint: Run mainloop at 30fps raw when doing skeletons. DepthAndPlayer works fine if you do this. Does DepthAndPlayer do anything btw?
