  1.  Playback (Kinect2 Tools Microsoft)
  
  Create playback of sensor stream using Kinect for Windows Tools, aplications using Kinect2 will receive content of this playback
  
  *Extract and save the frames from the XEF files containg Kinect stream recording, use StepOnce when real-time saving is not possible.
  *Prototype kinect interactions without the need to physically interact, prerecord the interaction session and  replay it while developing
  *Experiment with Kinect without the device attached (get DX11 pack sources or compiled release from after 11 Jan 2017)
  *Workshop scenarios often do not allow everyone to have the device connected. Playback the recorded example session.
