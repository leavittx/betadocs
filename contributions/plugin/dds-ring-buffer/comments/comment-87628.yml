  interesting.
  i'm using byte arrays for storage which you can't actively flush (the .NET garbage collector is supposed to clean that up when it feels like).
  I can provoke the garbage collector to get on with its job whenever you ask as well, so I can do that when the pin's changed
  (flushing GC manually results in a temporary pause of the whole app, something like 50ms)
