  @silver.smith: although I can't guarantee anything, I think the plugin is quite stable at this point in time. The most unstable part in my opinion is changing the slice-count, so try to keep that constant.
  
  Apart from that, try to keep your patch running at home for a few days if possible, and see if anything happens then :)
