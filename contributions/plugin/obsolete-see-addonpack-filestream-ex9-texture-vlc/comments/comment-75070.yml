  Awesome work, took me a while to use it properly but performances are actually really good.
  
  I can play 4, 5 fullHD layers at 30fps, best codecs for me are WMV and AVCHD/mp4 at 8-10M/s bitrate. Mov/H264 also has very decent performances.
  
  Spotted a little bug: position (seconds) and frame number keep incrementing even when play = 0.
  
  Thanks devs !
