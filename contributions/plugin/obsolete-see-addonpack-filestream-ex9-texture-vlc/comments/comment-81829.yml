  Hi ft
  yes maybe it's the same ventolinmono problem i have
  would you pls check:
  vlc0_5> one of the FX Texture module (Blur, Edge, Emboss etc.)> Preview FX Texture
  save the patch, open again.
  texture output of VLC is not correct (on my pc) 
  delete the link between VLC and FX, reconnect again- everything works again.
  can you reproduce?
