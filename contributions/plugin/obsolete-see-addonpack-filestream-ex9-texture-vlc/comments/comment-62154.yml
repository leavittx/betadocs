  if i want to play a dvd with "dvdsimple://X:\ etc." in a simple patch with a quad and a renderer the log shows that the texture is created and nothing else then it's playing smoothly.
  i have a bigger patch with a whole 3d scene, post-effects and other eye-candy stuff where i want to play movies from any dvd with the above method. when i connect the texture-out in the bigger patch (or hover the mouse above the texture-out pin) the log says "+++++++ creating renderer pair 0 +++++++" and then vvvv freezes down.
  this message wasn't displayed in the first small testing patch. what does it mean anyway?
