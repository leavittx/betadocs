  Hi.
  Interesting comments.
  
  About your tip for smooth playback :
  
  -is it only for the VLC plugin or do you use 2 textures for regular video playback in vvvv too ?
  -what do you call "filling up the other texture" ? how to you do it ? two textures nodes ? Do you have an example ?
  
  Thank you very much.
