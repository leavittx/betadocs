  Hello ft!
  
  Could it be possible that your latest version has lost a lot in performance? I saw that when I have two renderers on different screens and after I change the videofile my fps drops to 14-16 for a short moment (about 10-20 seconds) which I didn't achieve with the old version that had the deadlock problem?
  
  Greetings :)
