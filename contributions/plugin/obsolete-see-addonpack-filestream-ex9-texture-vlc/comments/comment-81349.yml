  Hello and thanks for this awesome plugin!
  
  I have a question concerning synchronized playback of several high resolution video files. That actually already was the question.
  More precisely: 
  Is there a way to play several looped 720p videos with the same amount of frames absolutely synchronized? I've done some testing and there's always a slightly varying frame difference. Sometimes more, sometimes less.
  The difference even gets bigger with every run if I don't integrate a feedback loop that hits doseek as soon as one of the videos has reached the final frame.
  
  would be awesome if there's a way to fix this.
