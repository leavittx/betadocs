  Whenever I open my patch the Quad with the Vlc texture is not there. I have to reconnect Texture Out. Â¿Why? I want it to play on startup. I noticed the same happens with *vlc0.5test beta27.1.v4p*. The Quad is white, then when you increase the slice count it shows the video.
  
  Also doing 'n' i have to press twice because the next video displays with pause, unlike 'p' that plays all files continuously.
  
  Anyway very nice plugin, it should go in the addonpack.
