  tried to use any of these two forks for some small project 
  and missed the very first functionality needed there:
  ability to use both direct (two-ways, triggered manually) 
  and ping-pong (triggered on timeout) transitions.
  
  also SetTransitionTime is missed in @microdee's fork (why?)
  which means need to manually edit all those times for any design change.
  which is pity, cause time-based approach looks way more reasonable
  (frame-based one requires calculating transition time from current fps, ouch)
