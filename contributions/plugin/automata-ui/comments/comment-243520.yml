  @princemio, that behaviour comes actually kind of for free. you can set the lock time for a state and just enable the transitions permanently (input pin set to 1) which goes from that state. hence after the state lock time the transition will automatically triggered. i was showing such use case in the node17 automata workshop. checkout the video.

  see the Done pin is set to enabled, therefore the done transitions activates once the "switchTopic" state finished its lock time.
  
  does this solve your problem ?
