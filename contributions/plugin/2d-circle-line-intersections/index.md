Some dynamic plugins to calculate intersections between finite lines and circles.

there are 3 cases:
2 circles.
circle - finite line.
2 finite lines.

It is also possible to transform the code for infinite line solutions.

Update:
Added Spreadable versions of 2 lines, and 2 circles intersection (still buggy).
The Line Circle version is not yet spreadable.
