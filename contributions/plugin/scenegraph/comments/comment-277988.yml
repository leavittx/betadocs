  Danged if I can find a way to get the texture transforms.  If I load a model that has a repeating texture applied, the texture is stretched to the whole mesh since there is no way to apply anything to the Texture Transform pin of a shader.
  
  The Assimp nodes suffer from the same problem - there is no Texture Transform output pin on the Materials node there either.  So is this just an artifact of the underlying library not supplying it?
  
  I was all excited to use this since it is so much more elegant than the native Assimp nodes, but this is a deal killer.  Pout.  Am I missing something?
