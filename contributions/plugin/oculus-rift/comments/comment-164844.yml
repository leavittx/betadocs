  hey mrboni,
  
  i just took what tidensbarn came up with (thanks!) and tried to correct the orientation problem that sonostrano mentioned by tweaking.
  
  what i got is most probably not the most optimal solution and should not be considered final, as slight derivations happily introduce nausea and disorientation.
  
  so i would be interested as well how some of this works, and also
  if there is a way to get direct-to-rift with 75Hz working.
