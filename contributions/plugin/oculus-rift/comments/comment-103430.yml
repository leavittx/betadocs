  Hey guys, thanks for the contributions!
  Everythings really nice, but...
  the Oculus keeps disconnecting permanently. When banging the Oculus again
  it's back to work, but this behaviour comes ang goes quite randomly...sometimes very often, sometimes stable for some time.
  TTY says nothing...it's getting worse with a heavy patch. Any ideas?
  Did you get the same behaviour? It's a big problem because the Oculus always
  needs to face the same direction for calibration, so as someone walks around
  and is not looking in one direction it's really a problem to rebang when the connection is lost...
  Thanks!
