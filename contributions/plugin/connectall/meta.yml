  This is an example from the *Plugin Coding for Beginners* workshop at [node10](http://node10.vvvv.org). 
  
  It takes a spread of 3d vectors and for each of those checks the distance to all other vectors. If that distance is below a given threshold the two vectors involved are added to the output spread. The actual distance between the two is returned on a second output pin. 
  
  for beta24.1: put the directory from the .zip in your \plugins directory
  for beta>24.1: does not need to be in the \plugins directory, desktop will do
