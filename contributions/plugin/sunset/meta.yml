  A small helper. With Inputnodes Worldposition(Lat, Lon) and Timezone it calculates the times of beginning/ending and outputs linear ramps. Could be helpful to regulate webcams (for example).
  
  As a small Bonus, theres a TimeNow-Output embedded, giving the actual time as a double - not as string.
