  @ beyon, ah yeah. very likely
  thanks for the spot
  i'm a little out of time to look into it right now and it's not obvious what's going wrong from inspection of the code. need to debug properly with a set of images.
  
  The issue with mixing resolutions is that you have to recreate the texture for every different size. It's definitely possible though, and a quick check on the size would mean that you wouldn't do this when the resolutions are the same.
  
  Will look into this next week after current project's over.
