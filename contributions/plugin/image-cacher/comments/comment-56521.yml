  Hmm this might be interesting as a starting point for my need of quick browsing through a bunch of highres images.
  
  Right now it doesn't seem to deal with different sizes of textures very well, I first tried loading a set of large images with date as filename but since that didn't work as a sequence I then tried another set of smaller size images and then the resulting texture output was the first large image with the smaller ones replacing the top of the image.
  
  I guess you don't recreate/resize the buffer when the filename pin changes?
