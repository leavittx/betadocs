  Pack of nodes for fast animation patching:
  
  * **Animator**
  Base logic for every tween with delay, repeat, seek, pause, etc. Fully spreadable and sync with internal timer. Replaces many animation nodes in one. Inspired by Zeh Fernando ([zeh](http://vvvv.org/users/zeh) ) <span class="node">tweener-(value)</span>.
  * **Ease**
  One node with easing presets (include google's swift  <http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html>), one for custom easing function.
  * **Lerp**
  Makes interpolation between value/spline/color/transform.
  
  ###  Update
  
  **v1.9**
  * Fix start & repeat pins banging only when delay finished
