  the white lines apear between black values & non black values. it is because you turned on texture filtering. if you set it from linear to point, they should disapear...
  
  ```
  sampler Samp = sampler_state    //sampler for doing the texture-lookup
  {
      Texture   = (Tex);          //apply a texture to the sampler
      MipFilter = POINT;         //sampler states
      MinFilter = POINT;
      MagFilter = POINT;
  };
  ```
