  Hi vvvveople,
  
  I'm trying to connect kinect to vvvv. The CLNUIDeviceTest is working properly. I updated all DLLs to Plugin folder.
  When I start a kinect patch example, I can see a "Starting" status in Kinect  (device patch) but no rendering display.
  
  I have tried all that was said above...any clue?
  Thks.
  
  PS: Good job vux :)
