  some things about kinect. Seems to be a little bit unstable (everytime i try to use the node in an existing patch (especially when a little bit complex) it throws error on the status, and i can't see nothing. For using it i must start a project with it and then add other things. And then it crashes for me everytime i want to go fullscreen with everything. anyway, i love it :D
