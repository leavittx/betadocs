  hej elliot,
  welcome back
  
  * column names cannot have spaces, since their name will be used directly as xml node identifier. can handle that case more gracefully though
  * repaint issue: indeed. seems even more noticeable now on win10 and highdpi. guess it would require quite a rework of event messaging...
  * checkbox out of bounds: definitely high dpi issue, just noticed myself here
  * colors: see github
  * GetColumns and bool: ja, bugger, will fix. 
  * GetColumn (Dynamic): the issue with that node would be, that it could change output pin (type) every time you change the index... therefore not implemented
  * GetRows: you mean something like GetTable (Dynamic) a pin per column outputting all available cells?
