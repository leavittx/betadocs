  @woei I had a go at making a getTable by name rather than index, but can't get it to work in a dynamic plugin (are you missing a directive or an assembly reference) I've added a reference to the complied table dll  and Im using like a type not a namespace. Dont know how to fix either of these!
  Seems like it should be easy?
  Any chance of a hand?
