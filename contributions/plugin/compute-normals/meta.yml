  ###  Compute normals for triangulated surface meshes
  
  ie pairs of vertices/indices sets.
   
   
  - Face normals: one normal per face (=triangle) of the mesh
  - Vertex normals: one (smooth) normal per vertex with different weighting options (area, angle,...)
  - Corner normals: one normal per indexed triangle corner
  
  
  This is basically a wrapper around libigl's(http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) functions to compute normals, more info here:
  http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#normals
  
   
     
     
  
   
  
  ###  Installation Note:
  
  Always copy the dependencies folder (+helpfiles) with the plugin!
  
   
     
        
  
   
  
  ###  Source Code:
  
  The source code for the vvvv plugin as well as for the unmanaged "libigl_Normals.dll" can be found in my addonpack fork:
  https://github.com/digitalwannabe/vvvv-sdk/tree/develop/vvvv45/addonpack/src/nodes/plugins/3d/3dComputeNormals
  
   
  
    
     
   
  
  ###  Licenses:
  
  All my code is MIT where possible; always happy about credit to digitalWannabe/lichterloh
  All code from libigl is MPL2

  Note:
  As this plugin is very useful for meshes generated by [tetgen](xref:contribution/tetgen), it will be included in it's next update. As such it will also be part of [d.o.p.e.](xref:contribution/d.o.p.e.), where it can help with shading deformed meshes correctly (-> next update)!
