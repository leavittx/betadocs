  Simple plugin that allows you to store a texture into a Texture2DArray, that you can then retrieve in shader.
  
  Different usages for it:
  * RingBuffer
  * Queue Texture
  * Simple operations from previous frame
  * Multi texturing with batched geometry
  * Random morphing
  * Custom animations
  
  ....
  
  Source code included, so you can see how simple it is to write custom plugins for DX11 (without having to look at the big github codebase).
