  @velcrome: I'm looking at your module. Can I spread also <span class="pin">LED Strip Lenght</span> with different values to control different matrices? Tomorrow I will test your module with my 28x16 led matrix and then I will report here. 
  
  Another question: what is <span class="pin">SlaveMode</span>?
  
  Thanks for the help!
