  Hey Velcrome, hey Catweasel.
  There was a further development of FastLED library and now  it can be used in conjunction with Octows2811 for apparently faster communication:
  <https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Parallel-Output#making-octows2811-faster-with-fastled>
  The library includes an example code that makes use of it. 
  Apart from it I also found another arduino sketch that is used to communicate with TouchDesigner.
  Unfortunately I could not figure out what is needed to be changed in your plugin/patch in order to make it work.
  Maybe you can have a quick look into it?
  I am not sure if this is worthwhile but any performance gain is a good thing.
  This is the link to the sketch I found.

  Thanks for the help!
