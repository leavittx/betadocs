  Hey velcrome,
  I tested your module with my 28x16 led matrix (56 leds x 8 Teensy pins) but only first 8 strips (4 Teensy pins) work. The other leds are off. 
  
  Working leds also flashing.
  
  [Catweasel](http://vvvv.org/users/Catweasel) module works fine with the same setup. Any suggestion?
  
  Please look at the simple attached patch.
