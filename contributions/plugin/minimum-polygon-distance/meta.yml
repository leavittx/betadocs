  Get minimal distance of two or more arbitrary convex polygons.
  Calculation using [Rotating Calipers](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~orm/mind2p.html).
  
  Should work with polygons of any edge point number.
  
  Please note that:
  * Polygons have to be convex
  * Corner points of polygons have to be ordered clockwise
  * No collision detection is performed (i.e. overlapping polygons do not have a distance of zero. Probably could use <span class="node">HitTest (2d Polygon)</span>for that.
  
  
  Outputs a distance matrix containing all distances between all input polygons. Also, the closest points between the polygons are supplied.
  
  
  **Not heavily tested - use with caution!**
  Any feedback or suggestions for improvement is welcome.
