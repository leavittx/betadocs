  Hey folks,
  
  I installed the drivers like u7angel said but I can´t get the kinect to work under beta 27.1. The Driver Pin of the Kinect(Devices OpenNI) node says "Unable to connect to Device!" but I can receive a depth picture. Skeleton node and everything else refuse to work... The Kinect(Devices Microsoft) turns red after a few seconds...
  
  Here the list of the installed drivers:
  **OpenNI 1.5.2.23 (32bit, stable, redist edition)**
  **NITE 1.5.2.21 (32bit, stable, redist edition)**
  **SensorKinect091 5.1.0.25 (32bit)**
  
  As I mentioned earlier I´m working with a MacBookPro with Bootcamp and Win 7 32 bit.
  
  Anyhow, I will move to this thread to [/forum-alpha/openni-for-alpha27.1](/forum-alpha/openni-for-alpha27.1) since I´m working under beta27.1 now.
