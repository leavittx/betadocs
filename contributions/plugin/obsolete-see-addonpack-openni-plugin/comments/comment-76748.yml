  Hi, thanks for the great work.
  I've been trying to figure out the rotation from the skeleton node and am a little lost. Are there any examples or could somebody provide one?
  What i wanted to do is to align a mesh to e.g. the head, with the correct rotation. Now i cant seem to figure how to use the x, y, z vectors provided for the orientation to rotate my mesh in the correct way.
