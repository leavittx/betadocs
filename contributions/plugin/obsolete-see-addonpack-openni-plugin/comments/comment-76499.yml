  hey fellow vvvv nerds!
  I am currently facing a strange problem with the kinect plugin in vvvv. I installed all the drivers necessary and everything is fine except the fact that the skeleton node doesn´t seem to work properly. I receive a depth buffer picture and everything but the skeleton won´t show up in the renderer. I tried to deinstall/install the drivers several times but no changes...
  
  attached you´ll find a screenshot of the tty renderer...

  help is much appreciated - thanks!
