  hi , i tested with last alpha and it works , for those that have problems installing right version i installed those and work for me  http://simple-openni.googlecode.com/files/SimpleOpenNI-0.24-win32.zip 
  
  the Adapt to RGB View in the Depth did not seem to do anything in my side at least in histogram mode , i tried with the rgb connected to the kinect one and set to enable also connected to renderer and enable disable nodes .
  
  is there any gesture for hand open and hand close ? 
  
  btw any chance to have kinect simulator so you can load videos ? 
  
  it will be great for preparing setups , simulation comparing real tracking with videos for games ...  
  i found this http://brandynwhite.com/fakenect-openkinect-driver-simulator-experime 
  
  cheers
