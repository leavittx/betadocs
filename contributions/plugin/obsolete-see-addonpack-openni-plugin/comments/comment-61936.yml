  on the skeleton i have 3 textures
  user textre, rgb texture, mask texture
  
  user texture is the one that im using as a mask because if i set the "background" pin to 0 its tracks me the subject and keeps the depth information
  
  mask texture its only a solid color, and im not able to view any changes in the layer that im selecting, it seems to be a mask of the subject only and the color its full white, no z info here ( this with background = 1 ). With background 0 its the same, but its like a render box with the clear set to 0.
  
  can you show me an example ?
  
  and YES, that video that you made its what i want to do. Where do i need to start  with ? ( i have no idea how to use a pipet :( )
