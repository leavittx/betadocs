  Hi Hierro, I'm waiting for the microsoft sdk too, while studing basics of c#. I know the limitation of the openNI framework.. It's all in the pdf they release from the beginning, and I'm really disappointed with this.
  
  I understand what effort the devvvvs are making to make the VVVVorld a better place, while also working on other project to earn something.
  I do the same... but not with programming.
  
  BTW
  
  My goal is to manage the hand tracking.. make a vvvv plug-in like the one for skeleton, but just for hands 
  
  Cheers
  
  PS: Ho visto il sito della tua societ√†.. da paura!
  Congratulation for your work!
  
  and thanks for sharing..
