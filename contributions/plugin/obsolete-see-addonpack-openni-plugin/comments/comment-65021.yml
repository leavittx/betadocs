  @hierro:
  what does the confidence property? 
  when there problems come up with the enumeration let me know. 
  Source code will also follow. At the moment I'm not sure where to put it. Probably i commit it to github. 
  
  
  @everyoneishappy
  It is recommended to use the drivers in the package. Some namings of function and properties which i used chnaged in the api. 
  hierros plugin should still work with the  new drivers. for me it does.
