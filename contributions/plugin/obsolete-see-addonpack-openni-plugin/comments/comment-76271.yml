  @justnice: what exactly did you give a shot? 
  you should get the latest alpha + addonpack, nothing more. start it up, create a Kinect (Devices OpenNI) node and hover its rightmost output. there you should see either: "Failed to connect to device" in which case something seems wrong with your drivers or a list of 3 drivers and their version numbers. please report what you get.
