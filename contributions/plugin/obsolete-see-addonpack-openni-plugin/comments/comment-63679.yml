  @mrboni : yes i did it when .39 was released, actually im using it on a project, still dunno if it will be commercial or not, anyway i dont think i can share it until project is not finished, btw i m waiting for microsoft sdk for a possible direction change.
  
  @weareallclowns : if u check the nite/openni example you will find a couple of exe that track just hands without skeleton, actually it can be implemented in several ways, using .NET too, hope i got your point.
  
  @SITD_NL : in the new OpenniSDK there's something about the autogain of camera or something "auto", but until now changing that setting didn't give any result if not even a crash; didn't try myself cos im not working with pointcloud, anyway the issue is visible as you noticed.
