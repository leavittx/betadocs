This plugin allows you to easily send geometry and other data from Grasshopper for McNeels Rhinoceros to vvvv in almost realtime. 

* send Meshes
* send Points
* send Numbers (floats)
* send Text (strings)
* send Rhino Camera from ActiveViewport

The data is stored and exchanged via an *.vltr file. So you can also use it via a network folder or send the file to somebody else.
