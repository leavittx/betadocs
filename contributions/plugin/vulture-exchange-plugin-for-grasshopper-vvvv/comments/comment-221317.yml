  What versions of VVVV and Grasshopper does this require? I have GH 0.9.0076 and VVVV 45beta34.2 x64 and cannot get it to work in either. I have the four files from the Grasshopper folder copied into my GH library folder, and I've placed the two VVVV files into VVVV\packs\vulture
  
  Grasshopper gives me a red balloon, stating that the assembly cannot be found: "1. Solution exception:Could not load file or assembly 'vulture, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified."
  
  VVVV node, when pointing to the supplied test file, alternates between red node and grey every few seconds, with no output in either state.
  
  I have a feeling I've just placed something in the wrong folder, or pointed something to the wrong location, but I've exhausted all ideas.
