**EXEC**plugin executes a program with given command-line arguments and output the results (*StdOut*), errors(*StdErr*), Process ID, the current status of the program and the exit code.

You can show/hide the program main window or choose if the program is executed in parallel, before you start the process.

In parallel mode you can force the program to stop with the kill pin.
