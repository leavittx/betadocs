This series of patches forms part of a video mixer project im working on, 
i tried to create them to easily integrate in any project, all modules have a    minimal GUI,and are optimized for performance, hope people find it useful.

-GridVideo : Allow to select Quicktime movies with vj style in the folder you choose.It includes a ffmpeg powered thumbnail generator to make things easier.
-BPM Tap : Simple Tapper.
-Audio Tool : Complete audio analysis with Hysteresis tool and range selector.Awesome response at the speed of sound.

at the moment there are several modules planned for release soon:

-LFO.
-Spreader.
-Layer system.
