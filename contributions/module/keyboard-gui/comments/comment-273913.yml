  Hi [Bartuc](http://vvvv.org/users/Bartuc)! I'm using your contribution but seems keys 8 and 9 has strange behaivour. Looking at Typewriter node of your help patch if I press 8 the last character is substitute and if I press 9 a lot of space character are insert before 9. Could you please have a look?
  
  Is it also possible to substitute Maj with Shift?
  
  Let me know! Thanks!
