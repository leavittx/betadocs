  I found DX11 text a bit hard to wrangle when making GUIs because text will resize when the renderer resizes.
  So I made this hacky patch that undoes all of the text nodes internal logic and makes text live inside a quad transform regardless of renderer size or quad shape. 
  
  Now spreadable! 
  TransX bug fixed
   
  Free/Open Source/Go Crazy
  Made with DX11 v1.01 x64 
  and vvvv50beta35.2_x64
  
  Limitations: 
  It works best in single line mode with short strings. There is a multi line mode but it's a bit unpredictable and will sometimes break its bounds.
