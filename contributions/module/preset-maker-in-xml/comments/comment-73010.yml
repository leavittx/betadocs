  Bonjour, Preset XML red, and it's in same dir with patch... I think the name of the file is problem, as i rember i had some modules like "super duper (Device)" you cannot acess it by typing "super" only "duper". Ah-a and that was a problem removed space before xml "PresetXML (File).v4p" now works like charm!   Thankkkk yooouuu!
