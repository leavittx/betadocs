  Hi
  <div class="box">
  DISCLAIMER: this mostly a php/mysql hack to connect to whatsapp and not a native solution, you ll need a php interpreter and a mysql server to get this running. Due to the ever changing nature of the Whatsapp non-existent-wannabe-API I may not want to implement a native solution, let s see how things go, feel free to implement any way you like.
  </div>
  
  HOWTO:
  
  >- you need a local or remote mysql server, if it is a remote remember to enable remote connection, of course. If don t want to allow external connection in your own server and comprise your data security, I highly advice to try with https://cloud.xeround.com, it s free and they even give you support.
  You can find a template for the table you need to have in your database, basically with the following fields
  
  1. Id (auto increment)
  1. User (varchar)
  1. Text (varchar)
  1. Media (varchar)
  1. Date (timestamp, default to now)
  
  >- open ./script/main.php and fill the necessary fields, if you don t want to use your own telephone number (loading the script will temporarily invalidate your whatsapp account in your phone), you can get a second free number with any provider, I am using http://fonyou.es/ if you know about similar services in your country please send in a comment below.
  Upload the script and the whole ./script folder to your server (and connect with ssh) or use it locally if you want.
  ```
  php main.php
  ```
  If you run it through ssh remember to use screen so it won t quit when you close the terminal.
  Send some messages and refresh the DB. If you can see your messages, move on.
  
  >- time to open the included patch to retrieve the messages and write the media, for the moment only images are retrieved, videos seems to be nested down and haven t fixed that yet
  THE NEW POLICY SEEMS TO BE THAT WHATSAPP DELETE MEDIA AFTER A FEW DAYS
