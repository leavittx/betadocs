  ####  Notice
  
  * Thanks to [catweasel](http://vvvv.org/users/catweasel) for the great MultiscreenCat 
  
  * Thanks to Xucong for testing & feedback http://surrealred.com/
  
  * I don't know how to use the node Text(DX11) properly because it seems to display in a fixed font size. You can use hotkey "f + left / right" to change the font size if needed.  
  
  * Tested on vvvv 33.7 x86 & 34.2 x86.
  
  * Open the help patch to see how it works.
  
  * Hope you feel it useful.
