  Perfect! I had just started patching something similar but now I don't have to finish that.
  
  I added speed up/down with PageUp and PageDown controlling a counter (0.25 to 10 with 0.25 increment) and then squaring the output of that.
  
  Might add far clip up/down keys to.
  
  The old standard camera controls sure was cumbersome.
