  Looks cool :)
  You can loose the Mio bit on the module name if you like and then it keeps with the naming conventions, but you can add tags in the shader
  //@author: vux
  //@help: template for texture fx
  //@tags: texture
  //@credits: 
  
  for example, and in the patch with ctl+m
  
  Nice first contribution!
