  Heya, these are for the iOS version of Lemur, regardless of the hardware it runs on. Successfully tested on both. Tthe iPad version of the Lemur software is more fun due to more screen real estate ;) I dunno about the Lemur hardware though, never had one so far, but reading the manual it should work well with it too (if it doesn't, check the port settings).
  
  Would it make sense to add OSC to the title?
