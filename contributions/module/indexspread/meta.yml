  This module, fed with an integer, returns a spread of indices suitable for (m)any mesh.
  Pattern is:
  
  012
  230
  456
  674
  ...
  
  Changing this pattern is strongly suggested, as nice results can be achieved, but make sure to save your patch, first.
  
  Help patch included.
  
  Would it be useful having a spreadable <span class="pin">Input</span>? Suggestions on improvement?
  
  Hope is useful.
  
  Ciao
