  Good question.
  Well, create a randomspread and with it substitute the vertices position spread of box (link the output pin of randomspread <EDIT to the count linked to the "/" linked> to vertexbuffer down IndexSpread). Then change to any value its spreadcount.
  
  Here is working fine. Let me know, please.
