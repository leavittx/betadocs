  Change font size according to height of IOBox
  
  As suggested by mrboni here:
  [/forum/feature-request-scale-iobox-text-px-size-based-on-io-box-size](/forum/feature-request-scale-iobox-text-px-size-based-on-io-box-size)
  
  
  how to use:
  - place into root patch
  - hold Shift while scaling an IOBox
  
  limitations:
  - only 1 box at a time
  - does not take enumerations amount into account
  
  bug:
  - IOBox sometimes not movable after scaling
  workaround:
  - scale again without holding Shift
  - to prevent this from happening start scaling first, then hold Shift
  
  v.1.1
  
  - can be placed into root patch now
