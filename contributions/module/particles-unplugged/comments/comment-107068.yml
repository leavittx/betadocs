  Hi Martin, I'm using VVVV and dx11 32 bit.. (win7x64, nvidia quadro2000 as I said)
  Can someone explain me what
  ```
  00:02:25 ERR : SlimDX.Direct3D11.Direct3D11Exception in SlimDX: E_INVALIDARG: An invalid parameter was passed to the returning function (-2147024809)
  ```
  means?
  
  Is this contrib using SlimDX? and what parameter was passed?
  Is this related to variable type? I don't know because I just learned int-long-float-double... and I know that they can have some limit in bit you can put inside them
  
  Thanks
