  OK, seems to work with a stride of 48, now why is that? There are 17 properties in the particle buffer, which would give a stride of 68, but the patch is set by default to 56, and only works for me with 48.
  Is this Nvidia maxing out the stride?
  Does anyone have this working as Martin posted it? Ati or Nvidia?
  Does my patch work for anyone?
  
  BTW if you use the quad, the scale seems to be at 1, try 0.001 if your screen goes white!
