  Hi Catweasel.
  your patch works here.. well, not really, but I can see some particle.
  I can't really manage their behaviour.. the fan of the videocard is going crazy and when I reset the stopwatch the render is filled with with square and the system become unstable for 5 secs.

  Apart from this I really trust this contribution, It seems a good concept, but I really don't know how to help to make it work stable.
  
  Thanks
