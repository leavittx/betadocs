Hi all, this module should help finding which wiki translated pages, here on vvvv.org, should be updated, based on their last modification date compared with the one of correspondent English page.
It lets user choose a language to check, returning a spread of URLs to update.
An internet connection is needed. -_-"
Helppatch included; done with 31.2_x86.
