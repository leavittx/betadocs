  hi, i have tried the above patches but i can't manage to make them work as they should..i mean that the only thing that works is the x and y axis on the left analog stick, for example when i move the right analog stick it detects as if i were pressing other buttons such as X, O, L1, R1 ecc...
  any clue on why this happens??
