  Generates a wiggle-effect like the one in Adobe's After Effects. Useful for any kind of animation that needs some natural look.
  
  Generates a pseudorandom motion that is based on a set of sinusoids. You have control over the motion's characteristics (number of octaves, frequency falloff - smooth or jerky).
  
  Fully spreadable + help patch included. V2.0 now supports dynamic slowdown / speedup of all elements.
  
  I hope this doesn't miss anything in functionality - let me know.
  Could be worth getting into the addon-pack!?
  
  Have fun
  Elio
