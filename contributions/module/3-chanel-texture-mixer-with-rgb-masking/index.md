This is my main mixer for Vjing. 

Just add your content patch, be sure to have a Dx.Texture and a S node with the name of the content

Select the content for layer 1,2,3 or control layer.

It provides  3 Chanel mixer for 3 textures,
The faders work as a blend or multiply depending on positive or negative values.

2D transformation for each layer ( including control layer )
control layer works as a  RGB mask, where R is Layer 1, G Layer 2, B Layer 3.

This provides a quick way of doing complex compositions

This is my first contribution, i hope you like it :)
