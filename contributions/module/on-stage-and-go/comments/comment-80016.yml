  bonjour deby.
  cues top level list in the GUI needed: medias, timings etc...
  would be better for your patch to have entry points where user  can set media files. it works ok , but needs more ergonomy.
  excel editing: would be better to edit tempos etc... inside a DX9 GUI (despite its ressource consumming) ( GDI ?) and backup it in excel ;-)
  
  Voilà !
