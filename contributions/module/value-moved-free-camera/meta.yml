  since i stuggled a few days ago to find an ego- shooter camera or a flying camera controlled by vvvv-values, i tried to solve it by myself and after a few hour of geometry brainfuck, i landed with this solution. this patch computes a for- and back-movement and a rotation into x-z axis and you can use this logic also for other axis. 
  so if you looking for a free moving camera this may be helpfull

  calculates a back and forward movement and a rotation into x-z axis with a sinus waveshaper like a ego-shooter camera, a flying camera or free moving camera controlled by vvvv values
