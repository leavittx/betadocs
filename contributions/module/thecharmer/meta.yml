  I love to synchronize music with visuals, so here is my module controller:
  
  * Stereo FFT (BassOut, LoMidOut, HiMidOut and HiOut)
  * LFO Controlled by Keyboard (Audio and Sampler Mode)
  * Simple monitoring using vvvv IOBoxes

   Video Example: http://vimeo.com/28511226
  
  ##  **How it works?**
  
  1. Play some Music.
  2. Tap SHIFT to set the BMP.
  3. Fix the BMP with AvPag and RePag.
  4. Reverse LFO with Backspace.
  5. Press TAB for PingPong Mode.
  6. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 divides the Measure.
  7. UP and DOWN Keys change manually the Top slide in the Chopper.
  8. CTRL + UP or DOWN changes manually the Bottom slide in the Chopper.
  9. HOME Resets the LFO 
  (CTRL + HOME and 1 too)
  10. 6, 7, 8 and 9 Slower the Measure.
  11. | Audio Reactive LFO
  (Numbers divisions and manual 
  Chopper also works in this mode).
  12. ESC Pauses the LFO.
