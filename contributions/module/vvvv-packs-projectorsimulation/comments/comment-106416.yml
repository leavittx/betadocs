  thnx elliot, this is really great. i looked into the depth render subpatch and blended the depth texture with some of my own visuals.
  
  I know i am doing it the faky way because i know you are using the depthrender in order to factor in the distance to brightness relationship. but I couldnt see any other way to actually project dx9 textures, like the old projected texture contribution. hence everything is in blau.
  
  the 3d model is something made with rhion + grasshopper, as a side note.
  
  any hints at how i can modify it so that i can also bring in dx9 textures ? only because I want to actually redesign some elements you see in this facade applciation to work better with projections...
