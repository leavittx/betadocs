This is an evolution of the original Keyframer from Catweasel :

   - It is now spreadable, means you can record several value in the same time, but as the "Time in" pin is not spreadable for the moment, you can't record several values at different time. 

   - It's also allows you to add records to a previously recorded sequence 


Still requires saving and reloading the patch for the keyframes to appear.. Any help from vvvvdevs would be really appreciate.
