  love the idea of moving the points with the keys
  i would like to do the same with a 3x3 grid for more precise mapping
  i will take this patch as a example
  
  i would like to add a feature to control the amount of blending
  did you test it already with beamers ? if i put the 3 grids in blend,add it over exposed in the intersection area. Are you sure its well calculated?
  
  great patch anyway! thnks for sharing
