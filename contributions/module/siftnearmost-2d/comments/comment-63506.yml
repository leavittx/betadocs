  Beta25.1 corrupts a few Nodes when loading the Beta23-version.
  
  It changes  <span class="node">Transform (Transform 2d)</span> into <span class="node">Translate (Transform)</span>, but when you change back in Beta25.1 it funnily remembers the Scale pin's values.
  
  Also it changes <span class="node">Vector (2d Join)</span> into <span class="node">Vector (3d Join)</span> but only inside the modules; not within the helppatch.
  
  really strange.
