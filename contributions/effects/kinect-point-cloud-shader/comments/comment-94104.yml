  @johansebastian I had met the same problem,and finally soleved it.You can try as the following steps:
  1.Push the right button of your mouse on the onlyColoredWorldXYZ node,and then you'll find that a code editor is open.
  2.Edit the codes in this window,change all the word "double" into "float".After all have finished,Ctrl + S to save the codes,and you'll definitely find that the red nodes will be back the gray ones!
  
  Hope this can help you^_^
