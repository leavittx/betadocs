  I think I might have found a bug. If you add a Switch(Node) to the output just before the renderer in the help file and you switch to something else once, it will either crash vvvv or cause all render output to be black.
  
  If you add a preview to HBAO it doesnt happen.
  
  Seems like HBAO doesn't like being turned off ;)
  
  edit: here is the error message after the switch
