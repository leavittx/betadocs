  Just got feedback from Dennis on github, problem now fixed if that could help others:
  
  I did a clean install of "vvvv_50beta37_x86" + DX11 and it's now running like a charm !
  (I think I got lost with an older vvvv version + Win 10 SDK / unity threads, but actually with latest clean install it's fine !)
  
  It looks beautiful, Thanks Dennis !
