  works for me as well, been experiencing some glitches when switching renderers, rewiring texture ressources, or having HBAO+ in a second patch like the help patch at the same time.
  vvvv was freezing on me and hovering texture pins would introduce a 1-2 second lag until vvvv recovered and a tooltip was shown.
  Will check tomorrow again to reproduce.
  
  Thank you!
