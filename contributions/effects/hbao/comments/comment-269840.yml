  Just disconnected the depth map going to HBAO+ and it really didn't like that. vvvv ram usage shoots up to around 13gb (the max available of the 16gb in my machine). TTY showing HBAO+ "not set to an instance of an object" message. 
  
  Could you set it so if no depth map is connected it is just disabled internally? vvvv keeps crashing on me without the depth map, even after restart.
  
  This is on beta36.
