  HBAO+ is a high effiency screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) algorithm developed by NVIDIA.
  This is a direct port for the vvvv dx11 pipeline by vux, made by exposing managed vvvv dx11 into native C++ dx11.
  
  ###  features
  
  * quite fast
  * lots of pins (some hidden), exposes nearly all options of the NVIDIA library
  * help patch, including explanations for every pin
  * based on HBAO+ 4.0
  
  ###  not done (yet?)
  
  * including your own normal buffer (rendering AO on normal maps)
  * dual layer depth input to remove halo artifacts
  
  ###  installation
  
  * make sure your dx11 pack is version >= 1.2
  * drop it into your packs folder
