  Hi lecloneur,
  
  The screenshots and the video of SPECTRAL KINECT looks amazing. Good Work !!
  
  I would want to run the patch but I am unable to. I just get a blank screen.
  I have Windows 7 (64 bit) with default kinect drivers installed.
  I am very new to vvvv, so need some guidance.

  Thanks in advance
