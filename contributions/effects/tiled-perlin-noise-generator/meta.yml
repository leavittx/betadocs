  Patch to generate a stitchable perlin noise using flash.
  
  Flash 10 has a function to generate stitchable perlin noise textures.
  
  VVVV talks to flash using XML sockets. 
  
  Loads of settings to play with.
  
  See more on the function here http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/display/BitmapData.html#perlinNoise%28%29
