  Yes of course. Yesterday wasn't work at all, now IT'S WORKING...
  How could it be possible!!??!??!
  
  I'm using MrWiggle DX11, I suppose I need a Fog in post processing.
  Or maybe I need the right skill to merge those shader.
  
  Anyway Thanks a lot!
  I think I'm the only one that use Fog in this forum... ajahahha
