  Since I've been asked a lot about shaders from this video: https://vimeo.com/114882796 I've decided to upload them, they are pretty simple and completely amature though. Also I've added several cheesy transitions from https://glsl.io/ too, couple of them are very good for creating glitched images. Hope it will be useful for someone!
