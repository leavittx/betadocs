  given a set of 3d positions the shader interpolates to a higher resolution and calulates lines/curves/splines/ribbons with phong shading.
  
  
  <div class="box">
  **v.0.2**
  * equal vs and ps version for ati cards
  * fixed texture coordinates
  * fixed thickness calculation for bezier
  * spelling and some code beauty
  
  **v.0.1**
