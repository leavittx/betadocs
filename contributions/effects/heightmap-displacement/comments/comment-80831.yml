  Normals were computed for Displacement along Y-Axis, but all helppatches displaced along Z-Axis. Also I changed the float4 normals' w-component to 0 ...
  
  I changed this line:
  float4 N = float4(normalize(float3(dX, 1.0f/normalStrength, dY)), 1.0f);
  
  to
  
  float4 N = float4(normalize(float3(dX, dY, 1.0f/normalStrength)), 0);
