  He milo,
  I've been trying to do the same, thanks for the hint towards this Sobel-Filter stuff ... I've been trying to do the calculation in VS.
  
  Small fix though:
  Neighbouring-Pixel-Calculation ignores amount-Pin for Displacement.
  0 or negative values seemed pretty awkward.
  
  So I changed
  
  float tl = abs(tex2D (SampDisplace, In.TexCddispla +texelSize  * float2(-1, -1)).x);
  
  to
  
  float tl = tex2D (SampDisplace, In.TexCddispla +texelSize  * float2(-1, -1)).x*amount;
  
  and so on ...
  
  Hope I didn't break anything, but looks good.
