  it outputs nothing but black for me. i have an ati card so if ps 3.0 is used the vs 3.0 must be used as well. so i looked in the shader code and i didn't really found a function for vertex shading at all. in tc0 technique i just found pixelshader=compile ps_3_0 no vertex shader. so i managed to add vs code and i hammered the passes until it displayed something reasonable.
  here's the code. is its output correct? if it isn't please correct it for ati cards, anyway you understand your own code better.
