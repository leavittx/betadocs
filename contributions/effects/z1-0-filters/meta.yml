  There are some texture filters I used in my previous work:
  
  **filterBlurredContours:**
  Draws an image from continuous lines.
  
  **filterContour:**
  Finds a contour, or edges on a picture.
  
  **filterEdge:**
  Just a high-pass filter.
  
  **filterOneSideLine:**
  Draws a border line around white places on a picture.
  
  **filterSlowDown:**
  surprisingly **very useful** effect
  It's handy to slow down visual effect. It can make a motion blur, or it can slowly show your effect instead of to let it appear suddenly.
