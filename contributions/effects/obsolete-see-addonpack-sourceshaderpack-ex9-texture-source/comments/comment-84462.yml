  Hi clone
  thanks for contributions.
  Liquish - do you think it's possible to make alpha value working in 4 colors?
  would be nice for composing to have parts of image transparent.
  Bubble and Lava are nice but quite heavy for real time use, especially with static time (?)
  Electricity - BG color  - it's possible get alpha working?
  cheers
