  hi all,
  
  @ Robe, I don't know why the Filetexture node lost his Volume Texture setup really. 
  
  @Tonfilm : I will try my best to put all that on the sdk.
  
  @ Dimix : thanks for all the feedback, always appreciate. For the liquish I will try my best to make alpha value, it's a good idea indeed to have it.
  For bubble and lava, try to use it with a resolution like 512*512 or even smaller, 1024 is too big and make it slow to load.
  Electricity shader, same, I will try to have the alpha working.
  
  Cheers.
  
  
  PS : Dimix, I know that you made some interesting module based on a combination of shader. I have some patch like that as well, we should really think of releasing those shader module as a contribution as well. What do you think ?
