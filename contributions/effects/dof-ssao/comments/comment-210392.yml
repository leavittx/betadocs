  I just discovered these little gems, amazing how fast, clean and easy they work. And they only need depth channel, great. Thank you for porting Antokhio, that is so useful!
  
  I got one question about the DOF autofocus: I like it, but it does adjust very quickly, nearly instantly, when a new object comes into center of view. Is there a way to adjust the speed of this? I studied to code of the shader but got lost.
  
  And another question: In case one would want to use both, would it make any sense speedwise - if possible - to merge them into one shader?
