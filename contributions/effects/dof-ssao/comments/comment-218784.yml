  These are fantastic! Thanks antokhio!
  
  Got some great results instantly here!
  
  One thing I'm struggling with using your (BEAUTIFUL!) DOF: when in autofocus mode, the actual focus area is really nice and tight, literally a hairs-breadth. I'm aiming for the "looking at something incredibly tiny" effect, so this is exactly the look I need.. I'm sort of with Meierhans on the subject of jumpy focus however, so I want to use manual control. The problem I have in manual mode is that I can't seem to get any near-blur working? Thanks to the useful blur highlighting mode you've built in I can get the far-start and far-end where I like them, but everything in front is in focus no matter what input i give the near-start and near-end controls... Using the highlighting mode, this area just stays orange no matter what I do? :(
  
  Am I missing something here?
  
  Again, thanks for such awesome and resource-light effects! Props!
