  This are some experiments about combining instancing with tesselation and displacement.
  
  Can be useful base for terrain or water and more. Although it would need some polishing, like connecting the tiles better.
  
  I might clean up the folder more and wanted to push it into the dx11 at one point.
  
  Maybe will add more examples as well.
  Have also more pixelshader with instancing but need some sorting.
