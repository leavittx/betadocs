  Tnx catweasel,
  i had a look inside the shader and i found that the pixel shader is compiled with 2.b shader model. look at the bottom in the hlsl code of the shader, in the techniques:
  
  PixelShader = compile ps_2_b mainPS();
  
  maybe your graphic card is not compatible with this shader model. try to replace with:
  
  PixelShader = compile ps_3_0 mainPS();
  
  let me know
