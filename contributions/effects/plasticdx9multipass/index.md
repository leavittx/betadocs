This example shows how to apply one-pass-per-light shading to a plastic surface. The shading is done in DX9 ps2 - pixel shaded.
In this example, there are two point sources, one without falloff and one with "real" quadratic falloff, an infinitely-distant source, ambient light, and a fresnel reflection.
