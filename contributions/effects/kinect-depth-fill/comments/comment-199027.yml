  Unfortunately crashes on my Nvidia GTX 680 too.
  
  In my [dx11.pointcloud](xref:contribution/dx11.pointcloud) pack there are btw implementations of depth repair and depth smoothing algorithms ( see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/317974/KinectDepthSmoothing ).
  
  The nodes are called DepthRepair and DepthSmooth.
