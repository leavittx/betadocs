  @mrboni ah that's a pity... I have an AMD card, so I can't really test.
  I'm not that experienced with shaders... It might be a bit many texture sample lookups (although 9 per pixel doesn't seem that overwhelming). And for loops and ifs don't seem that cool in shaders either. If anyone has pointers, I'd be glad to improve on the shader :)
