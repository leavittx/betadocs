  re world-position:
  
  that would be truly cool. and i see two ways. one, recreate the world from depth with the help of <span class="node">RayTable</span>, and two, create a mesh from the "raw" depth and fill in the holes there, with a shader, and then creating the world from that (writing that shader is certainly over my head atm).
  
  the first method should be doable, actually i'll try it quickly...
  
  ... okay too tired. next week.
