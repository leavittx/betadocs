  A pixel shader which takes two textures as inputs and blends them together using a bunch of different blend modes from photoshop, and even some photoshop should include. There is an input for the second texture transparency. Includes a help file. The help file uses 2 movies as input, but the movies are not included.
  Includes a help file.
