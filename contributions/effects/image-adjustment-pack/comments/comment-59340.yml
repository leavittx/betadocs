  actually you can do the spreading of keycolors yourself. thats why its a FXH.
  
  there simple functions wrapped in these fxh files. so if you for example need a shader to control saturation, contrast and then keying out the green, you don't need to copy paste everything together but just include the .fxh and call the functions like:
  ```
  #include "path/Saturation.fxh"
  #include "path/Contrast.fxh"
  #include "path/ColorMatte.fxh"```
  and in the pixelshader
  ```
  float4 col=tex2d(Samp,In.TexCd)
  col = Saturation(col); 
  col = Contrast(col);
  col.a=ColorMatte(col);
  return col;```
  hope is, that this could prevent a lot of similar shaders (f)lying around
