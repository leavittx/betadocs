This is NOT a real datamosh procedure. It simulates the real artifact side-effect without the need to re-compress or to edit the file with a hex-editor. 
So it looks like "datamoshing" and you may possibly achieve better results by combining it with other Texture Effects such as distortion / morphing / edge and others of the same context...

The original effect was written in glsl by [Oliver Baudu](https://github.com/b01xy/glsl/blob/master/Customs/Datamoshing-II/datamosh-II.frag)

just put a video file or mix up to two different video files using both slots (in that case you wont need the <span class="node">Framedelay</span> ).



enjoy!
