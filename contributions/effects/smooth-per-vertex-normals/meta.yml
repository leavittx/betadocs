  It's based on calculating the adjacent faces of each vertex on the CPU in a dynamic plugin. As long as the typology of the mesh doesn't change this works fine.
  This data is then used to apply the previously calculated face-normals.
  
  I'm sure this can be greatly improved, so any comments and suggestions welcome.
  
  Still missing is a weighting of the normals like in this example:

  Based on GSFX Per vertex normals by lasal.
