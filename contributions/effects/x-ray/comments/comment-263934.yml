  i can not reproduce this, drag drop dx11 version as dx11 effect works in latest beta, ctrl-d works in latest beta. just tested both cases.
  
  so now i have to start with wild guesses..
  
  - incomplete vvvv installation - check setup.exe
  - broken unzip , try unzipping with winrar or 7-zip
  - system language can not cope with underscore ?
  - some fancy chars in the hlsl shader code ?
