  Hey man thank for this!
  Just cannot get the effect working when i istantiate it from scratch though - it works in your help patch, but even when i clone it (via CTRL+D) in the same patch, the Layout Output node says 0 and I cannot see the rendered geometry anymore..
  Does anyone else have this issue?
