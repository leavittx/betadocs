  Hey, like this shader very much.
  
  Found one little problem, if the object is in the center then we lose the layers, so couldn't use it initially with a skybox (Sphere+WithinView). Also stripes doesn't move on a static object. 
  
  Simple way to get around it (and nice feature) is just to add an offset for the Pixel Pos.
  ```
  float3 Offset;
  ```
  
  Then in the pixel shader part, replace:
  ```
  float3 PP = In.PixPos;
  ```
  by 
  ```
  float3 PP = In.PixPos + Offset;
  ```
  Then you can change stripes without the need to move the object.
  
  Thanks for the contrib :)
