  thanks bo )
  
  hi flateric,
  i thought about transformation of the layers structure
  and wanted to do it with transform, to suppot rotation also (when i tryed other shapes besides the sphere), but i can't use these matrices so easily yet...
  
  As rotation really doesn't make sense with a sphere, your solution is better,
  so i'll update it as you suggested,
  thank you *
