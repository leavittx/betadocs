  Thanks guy 
  Surface tension could be add to the particle , but i didn't get it to work both at the same time yet , should'nt be that hard. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension 
  For other purpose  it could use also different shape like quad , but then particle rotation should be add also ... not sure if it will work the same way with rotation.
  also independant mass relative to syze would be nice and easy to implement.
  To finish the Navier-Stokes things to get the nice curly things to get some kind of moving flow like in the fluid solver but i don't know if that's possible and navier stoke equation is still too complicate for me.
