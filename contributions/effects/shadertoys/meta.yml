  ported some shaders from https://www.shadertoy.com/ ...
  
  feel free to optimize and update this contribution.
  
  issues:
  * they'd better be written as .tfx
  * procedural noise is taking muuuch gpu - didn't get lut-versions to work
  * some glsl-leftovers
  * i'm sure there are more optimizations by using hlsl/dx11 advantages

  0.4 Added a ray marched primitives and a substitute(string) for converting the GLSL, look out for matrices that haven't been fully initiated (overloaded, I think is the term)
