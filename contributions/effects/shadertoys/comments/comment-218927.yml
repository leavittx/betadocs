  awesome! love this!
  
  so im totally new to hlsl, and admittedly its all completely abstract to me. (Coming from Cinema4D world, i just assumed a shader was simply a method of dressing a shape in 3d space... )
  
  this stuff appears to be rocket science!
  
  as an example, i saw "sculpture III" and had my socks blown clean off. the scope here for procedural dirt/rust maps is astonishing. this said, im struggling to get the generated geometry into my scene, it appears to only be a 2d texture... 
  
  ... can i not add realtime shadows? dof? etc? control camera movement? is there even geometry generated..?
