  hey, thanks for the feedback! i attached a fixed version which should run on ati cards. actually it's the exact same shader with the compile target set to vertexshader model 3.0. i have absolutely no idea why that is necessary, but it seems fair enough as long as it runs..
  
  edit: this also seems to work for other shaders which refuse to render on ati gpus.
  edit2: sorry, i uploaded the wrong version 0.2 first. if you've already downloaded it, please update for ati compatibility ;)
