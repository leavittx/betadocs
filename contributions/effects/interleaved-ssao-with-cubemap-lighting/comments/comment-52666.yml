  aze, thx for pointing out! -> fixed in 0.3a
  
  unfortunately it is much more difficult to go any further in dx9 with this sort of deferred approach. crytek uses a similar method for close to medium distance and a proprietary technique called temporal AA for medium to far distance objects, but then they are crytek.. :D
  as mentioned earlier: dx10 would really help here..
