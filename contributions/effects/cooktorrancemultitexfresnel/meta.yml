  Shading via multitexture. Two textures are interpolated over the surface, and their product results in the final specular BDRF.
  The initial textures supplied approximate a Cook-Torrance model using one set of possible parameters, but different textures can be used to emulate a wide variety of isotropic BRDF models.
  In this example lambertian diffuse is still supplied, but it is not required.
