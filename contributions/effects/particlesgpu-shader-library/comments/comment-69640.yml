  @Screamer; I fixed the second monitor output by opening all render windows, moving to second monitor, and then minimising back to patch. 
  With changing 'double' to 'float' and changing 'point' to  'pointy' and the other naming fixes, everything now appears to work perfectly on an ATI 4850.
  Fabulous stuff.
  
  Edit : The first way I tried to fix second head output was DX9Texture > AsVideo > VideoTexture. Worked, halved the frame rate.
  
  Edit 2 : No it doesn't :o/ At least I am having a good look at the actual shader code :oD
