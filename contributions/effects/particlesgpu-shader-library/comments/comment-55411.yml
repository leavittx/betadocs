  too bad...
  strange, i compiled both VS and PS with model 3.0, but seems the problem is not this for sprites...
  did you tried to set a lower number of particles? like 64 instead 512 (the default value in 2d sprite patch)
  ... i don't have any ATI card here, keep on with this updates, hope we'll fix it at the end.
