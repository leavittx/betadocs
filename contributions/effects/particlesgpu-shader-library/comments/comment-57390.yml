  oh nice update, I've got an odd problem though. In the new 3d Transform patch if I have OVER 9000! cubes the scaling is wrong, for instance if they're at uniform scale in xyz, and I have OVER 9000! then the Pitch input starts to affect scaling. Any ideas? I'm guessing it's to do with texture formats?
