  your code is wrong:
  -you create a float4 and assign to it the color from texture;
  -but then you overwrite the rgb channels with the phong component. in this way there will be no blend between these and your texture.
  this is the correct way:
  
  ```
  
  // PIXELSHADERS:
  
  float Alpha <float uimin=0.0; float uimax=1.0;> = 1;
  float4 PS(vs2ps In): COLOR
  {
     float4 col = PhongDirectional(In.NormV, In.ViewDirV, In.LightDirV);
     col *= tex2D(Samp, In.Tex2Cd); 
     col.a *= Alpha;
  
     return col ;
  }
  ```
  
  make shure the sampler (samp) is the one from your texture.
  and the texCoord are the same of the position texture.
