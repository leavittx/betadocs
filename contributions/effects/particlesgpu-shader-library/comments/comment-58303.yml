  helo,
   thank you for the great contribution
  wow!
  
  what is the difference between sprite3d and sprite2d?
  a scale with eg xscale=0 connected to the sprite3d does the same like sprite2d? or am i missing sth?
  the framerate is the same when using sprite2d
  
  that is not a critic just for better understanding when to use what..
  and
  if you already wrote this down in your mentioned .pdf ... ok i will wait for the documentation
