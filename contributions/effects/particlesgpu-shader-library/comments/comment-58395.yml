  Hi Dottore, 
  
  only a question,
  in the 2d Dynamic field texture, is there any way to transform all the system? like in the new bicubic surface? or add to the shader a transform all pin?.
  
  i want to make a symetrie and the only posible solution that iÂ´ve found is to make the transform in the camera.
  
  thanks again for your fantastic contribution.
