This is a simple port from the old reflections shader from nvdia in dx9 to dx11
Dont find the link from the old contribution.
Really easy to port,
I just added a cubemap Post fx module to blur or apply texture fx to cubemaps, and a little cubemap library for test, to make more interesting than the simple shader....
;)
Also the "infamous teapot" that any 3d software needs.
Includes fresnel reflection technique for glossy looks!
A must have in my setups.
Enjoy.
