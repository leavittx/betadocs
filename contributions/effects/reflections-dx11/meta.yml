  This is a simple port from the old reflections shader from nvdia in dx9 to dx11
  Dont find the link from the old contribution.
  Really easy to port,
  I just added a cubemap Post fx module to blur or apply texture fx to cubemaps, and a little cubemap library for test, to make more interesting than the simple shader....
  ;)
  Also the "infamous teapot" that any 3d software needs.
  Includes fresnel reflection technique for glossy looks!
  A must have in my setups.
  Enjoy.
