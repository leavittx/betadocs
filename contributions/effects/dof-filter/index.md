yet another DOF. it's a bit simpler than the already existing ones but a bit nicer (blur techniques are made by [kalle)](http://vvvv.org/users/kalle)) and slower. more info in the help patch.
addonpack is required for this.
so i hope you like it!:) if you see some potential improvements or ideas what i haven't discovered yet on any part of this feel free to write it down.
