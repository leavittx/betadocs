  ##  Change log:
  
  * DOF 2.0
  Technique developped by Infinity Ward for *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare* that provides depth of field's key qualitative features in both the foreground and the background with minimal impact on total system performance or engine architecture. Requires Shader Model 2.0 hardware.
  
  * DOF 1.1
  new blur technique: gaussian blur (modified to blur correctly non square textures). better blur quality and also improved performances.
  
  * DOF 1.0
  Technique for rendering depth-of-field effects in realtime using image processing and compositing techniques with Poisson disc filtering. The use of a pre-blurred image in the post-processing step improves image quality by reducing aliasing artifacts. There are user friendly parameters for plane distance controls.
