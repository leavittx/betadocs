  ahh. just saw that something happened here. cool.
  Also tried to change the vertex shader version. still no effect.
  @dottore: my gfx card is a radeon x800gt. Read somewhere that this card uses pixelshader version 2.0. maybe that is the problem?
  i also tried to change the PS version from 3.0 to 2.0. Didn't change anything. Besides I think that your shader needs version 3.0 right?
