  **the help patches are working now** after following the suggestion of frostpfote:
  changing the version from 1 to 3 at the end of the code for 'DOF-combine.fx'
  <div class="box">quote:frostpfote:
  VertexShader = compile vs_3_0 VSDOF();
  </div>
  
  Can someone explain the need for this change ?
  Is it specific to my hardware ?
  and why don't I have to change the version in some of the other fx used in this module ?
