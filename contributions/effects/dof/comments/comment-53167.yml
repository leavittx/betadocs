  this looks great!
  Unfortunately i can't get it to work. When i open your help patch the big rendering window stays black except for the perfmeter. I only can see the color and depth pre-renderings. Tried it with 40beta23 and 45beta24. Same results.
  Do you have an idea why that could be wrong?
