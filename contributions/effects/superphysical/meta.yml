  SuperPhysical is a forward rendering setup and the successor of SuperPhong.
  It features cook-torrance shading, physically based rendering and image based lighting.
  The implementation is mainly based on <https://learnopengl.com/#!PBR/Theory>
  "focusing on the PBR approach as originally explored by Disney and adopted for real-time display by Epic Games".
  
  Some Features:
  * Physical Based Rendering
  * Metalness workflow compatible to Substance Designer etc.
  * Image Based Lighting
  * VSM Shadows
  * Image Based Refraction
  * Parrallax Occlusion Mapping
  
  
  Update 2.0:
  
  * Completely overhauled material and light setup powered by custom VL datatypes
  * New shadow mapping techniques: Exponential Shadow Maps (ESM) and Postfiltered VSM with varying penumbra size
  * Integrated volumetrics
  * Lot's of fixes and performance improvements
