  Hey!
  I am probably missing something, but do you have any advice regarding managing transforms on imported meshes with multiple subsets. It gets confusing really fast with massive spreads for the transforms. 
  Also material management. I started working on something like a material manager that writes xml files but it is going to be a long way till (if) it ever gets done. Mostly due to my limited skills in vvvv. 
  
  Thanks!
