  [mburk](http://vvvv.org/users/mburk) Thank you for the input. 
  To be completely hones it never occurred to me that i can merge material nodes ... 
  As for the geometry i suspected that there is a node to merge geometries, but i never found it as it turned out my noodles pack was trowing an error due to missing stuff. Reinstalled and all works now. 
  
  Thank you again for the awesome work!
