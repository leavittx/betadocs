  Hi manuel,
  I cannot reproduce the refraction issue.
  Please move these questions to the forum, I think it's more convenient to discuss there.
  Also please attach an example patch - this would help figure out the problem. My guess is, that refraction is not configured correctly in the material, but let's see.
