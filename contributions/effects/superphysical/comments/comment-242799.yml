  Yep, there is something wrong - I explained this in the workshop also:
  The "Global Reflection Color" is not really a correct part of the lighting equation, but somethin additional. i didn't combine this correctly yet, so that's were this bug comes from. If you do your lighting only with IBL and dynamic lights everything should be correct.
  
  If you are brave enough go to superphysical.tfx and replace Line 271 with this Line:
  
  IBL += (saturate(GlobalReflectionColor.rgb * (kS * envBRDF.x + envBRDF.y)) * iridescenceColor);
  
  
  
  This will also be fixed in next release.
