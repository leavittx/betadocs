  hey. there is no real solution to conveniently handle those situations. the best way would be to finish VL.GLTF implementation. I was working on an adapter, but have no time to pursue this atm. I usually don't work with complex hierarchies of importet assets, but would recommend to merge as much geometry as possible, for example with the instance noodles merge node.
  right now material handling is done the oldschool way and works by usual spreading.
  the deferred version already has the concept of material IDs, which are assigend to different meshes. check out the help patch and press "m" in the material preview to select a material. then press "m" and click a mesh on the renderer to assign it. this is only a proof of concept implementation atm.
  to manage materials you can have multiple material nodes and cons them together, to not have total spreading chaos.
