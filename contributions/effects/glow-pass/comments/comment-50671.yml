  i couldn't agree more!
  
  i'm trying my best to get my feet wet in HLSL and shader-porting, but until now there's always been someone quicker than me. (arkano22's ssao comes to mind.. maybe i should go back to that and try porting his updated version which does away with the 2d sampling)
  i won't give up though.. ;)
