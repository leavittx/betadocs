this is a proof of concept copy/paste-job from a relatively new SSAO implementation as initially posted by [ArKano22 on gamedev.net](http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=556187&PageSize=25&WhichPage=1). looks quite useable, check the ready-to-use module in the attachment.

there is still room for improvement though, especially with the global illumination technique that yet needs a better compositing mode with the original. also later in the thread ArKano22 postet a rendermonkey document that still could be compared for further source improvements.
