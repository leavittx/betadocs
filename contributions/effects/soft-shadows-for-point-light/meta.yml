  Soft shadows calculated from cubetexture depth so it works for point lights in every direction. It manages alpha channels too however <span class="node">AlphaTest (EX9.RenderState)</span> is required in that case. The softening technique is lame and simple as a rock so if anybody can do a better one please contribute it :P It's rendered separately so you just have to multiply the shadows on whatever scene you'd like to.
