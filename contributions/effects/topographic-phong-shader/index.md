Simple shader to apply topographic-map-like shading to a mesh using world Y.  Includes helper functions and plugin for generating the 1D texture and the palette used.  Can be easily changed to use object space instead of world, see inside the .fx file (maybe in v2 it will be settable...).

Thanks to all for the help in the forum discussion!
