  P.S. for calibration,
  it's good to input a grid texture, set useProjection to 1, and not use anyting on tProjector.
  That way, your grid will be projected directly in x,y onto your object, so you can calibrate.
  
  P.S. This shader generally presumes that all your projectors are in a line facing towards your target.
  It doesn't deal with multiple projectors that inwards / outwards onto a scene.
