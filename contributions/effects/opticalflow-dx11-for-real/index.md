This is my first contribution, if you have tips would be really worthy! 

It contains Optical Flow solutions based on Horn and Schunck and Lucas and Kanade papers. I used them for my bachelor thesis, introducing intrinsic variations (5x5 kernel for derivatives or iterations in HS) and extrinsic (preprocessing and postprocessing) that increase the quality of the prediction. The results are given in RGB and vector representation.
