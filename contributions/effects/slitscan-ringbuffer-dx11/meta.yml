  A ringbuffer in a volume texture and an appropriate texture-based slitscan shader.
  
  I've been on a long journey, seeking an appropriate way to do texture-based slitscan deformations. 
  
  I was a bit inspired by James George, who did (cpu-based) slitscanning in OF and finally had the idea to utilize a volume texture. Elektromeier did a related thing `elektromeier-khronosprojector` like about 8 years (!!) ago. That one was helpful, but still lacking the generation-part.
