  For users of Geforce 650 GT and similar 
  
  I am succeeded to use it on Windows 8.1 don't know about win 7 but here it works well. 
  The most important is to focus on Nvidia driver settings. In nvidias' #d settings there are are profiles for each program (to use internal intel 4000 either Nvidia processor). As my first thought was that both programs should use strictly nvidia was wrong. I made that mistake on windows7 as well. got both error messages that the video card is not supported as well as interloop error mentioned above. I have tried most of the settings and the 
  
  Key is to delete profiles from Nvidia settings for the both programs! 
  
  It works as it should. simple as that. Start vvvv in shared mode :
  
  creating .bat file with 
  @ECHO OFF
  start vvvv.exe /allowmultiple /dx9ex
  
  and not forgetting to put sharing name for the texture in plugin settings.
  
  If it won't work on windows 7, install 8, that's worth it.
