  you're a genius... thanks a lot... working fine in my laptop:
   
  msi GT780R with win7x64, NVIDIA GeForce GT 560M
  vvvv_45beta29.2_x86
  resolume 4.1.3
  
  love your plugin...
  
  I'm very interested about your discoveries: DX->DX, DX->GL, GL->DX, GL->GL ...
  I didn't imagine that could be posible ....
  
  
  Thanks... thanks a lot...
