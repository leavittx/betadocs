  Hi Martin,
  
  usually the VVVV Spout Sender is not directly visible in Spout Receiver when starting up your patch!
  To make your texture visible in Spout Receiver, choose "file > select sender" from the Spout Receiver-menu and type in the name of your sender (e.g. "vvvvideo"), then click "Select" and now your vvvv-texture should be visible in the receiver app. Now choose Resolume or whatever tool you want to use and there your vvvv-texture should be visible aswell.
  
  cheers
