  It's so exciting！！！	
  I was success make"State" inlet of "switch" node which is show "OK" in my "ShareTextureInfo (OpenGL, Interop).v4p" when I follow your method even only once.
      
  But resolume 4.1.6 still show me "NVidia wglDXInterop failed to initialize"
  (my GPU is GTX 780m,vvvv is 45beta31.2_x86 ，win7 x64).
  
   I has been setting NVIDIA control panel just GPU both vvvv and Resolume also Global.How can I kill Optimus!?
