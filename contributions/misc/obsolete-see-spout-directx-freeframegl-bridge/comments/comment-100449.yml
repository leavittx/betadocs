  hehehe "Nvidia wglDXInterop failed to initialize" on opening resolume!
  
  my gear:
  asus n75s with win7x64, NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M (drivers update)
  vvvv_45beta29.2_x86
  resolume 4.1.3
  
  I'm not expert in graphic card, so I have 2 question:
  1) going with dxdiag, I see that the projector is managed by the GT555M card, but the main monitor is managed by the internal Intel(R)HD graphics 3000...
  Perhaps this is the problem?
  
  2) I'M about to buy a new graphic card for the Desktop comp (till now I'm trying only in the laptop). How can I check if the new card have the "NVidia Interop Functions"? It is enough to check for the CUDA Library?
