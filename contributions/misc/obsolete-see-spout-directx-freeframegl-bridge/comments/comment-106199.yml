  No news from Elio for a loong time. Working hard or abandoned the project? 
  
  I don't know if this helps anybody: glCapsViewer is a OpenGL hardware capability database. It says my nvidia GT540m should support WGL_NV_DX_INTEROP when OpenGL 4.1/4.2/4.3 installed + WGL_NV_DX_interop2 when OpenGL 4.2/4.3 installed. But until now it didn't work. 
  http://www.delphigl.de/glcapsviewer/listreports.php?listreportsbyextension=WGL_NV_DX_interop
  
  so i checked my open gl driver version with GPU Caps Viewer 1.16.0
  http://www.geeks3d.com/20120412/gpu-caps-viewer-1-16-0-geforce-gtx-680-monitoring-opengl-opencl-cuda-utility/
  
  updated all intel (Intel HD Graphics 3000 seems to only support opengl 3.1 (problem?!)) and nvidia drivers (opengl version now is 4.2)
  
  ok... sooo
  
  once again 
  
  - downloaded a new version of vvvv (vvvv_45beta31_x86) (32bit because resolume runs in 32bit even though i have win7 64bit.)
  
  - in the nvidia preferences assingned vvvv.exe to run on nvidia graphics
  
  - created args.bat containing the following code:
  
  @echo off
  vvvv.exe /dx9ex
  
  - RR_DXTexture.dll is in my resolume plugin folder 
  
  - the other two .v4p patch files are in my vvvv root folder (together with the args.bat)
  
  - I start args.bat -> start ShareTextureInfo (OpenGl, Interop) help.v4p -> start resolume -> then DX Texture (RR) Root resolume source plugin
  
  -result: Error message "NVidia wglDXInterop failed to initialize"
  
  
  did i miss anything? It just won't work :(
