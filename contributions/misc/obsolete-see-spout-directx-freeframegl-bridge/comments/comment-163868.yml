  Nvidia are apparently updating their drivers to fix the spout issue with optimus, sometime around mid sept, so lets hope they have, and all will be good from there!
  I've also been in touch with the dev of TCPSyphon, and he is planning a spout receiver for syphon via TCP, which would be great, a x platform texture sharing!
