  Got News ... The 4rst Machine I Test ... (Quad Core Q9300 - GTX260 - Win7 64 bits) .... Vvvv the last version in 32bits... and the same manipulation I did in the previous posts... It Works ...
  I Think both My Laptop (With Nvidia Hybrid Chipset - Win8 64), My Work Desktop (Embed Geforce 7100 / nforce610 - Vista 32), and an old workstation (Quadro FX - XP 32) are not compatible ... Graphic Cards Too old, too specifique,... Too stupid ... To work with this ... really amazing plugins !!!
  
  I'm really desapointed because the only Machine that work With, is the only one i'll never take with me @ Gig... 
  So not useable for me ...
  
  Another point not written above on the utilisation :
  
  In resolume, Drop the Source plugin in Resolume
  Select it without launching
  give Him the Shared Texture path as written on the "Name for sharing" pin of the ShareTexture info Node ...
  
  If the Dev Need Testing ... I can Help...
