  Hi everybody,
  i'm working on the Wyphon plugin for Unity <>FFGL /Resolume, and i'm blocked with the FFGL ImportWyphon Plugin that is handling shared textures with DX9Ex device, i need to compile a full DX11 version in order to be able to share Unity's textures to Resolume.
  
  @elio : if you're still here, is it possible to talk with you about that ? my skype is ben_kuper and mail : bkuperberg@gmail.com
  
  Thank you
  
  EDIT : i got Wyphon fully working between Unity and Resolume in both direction !
  I have recompiled elio's FFGL plugin to be DX11 only, so there are less contraints on texture formats.
  
  I will post videos & sources as soon as i cleaned up the project.
