  For those who already got success rendering content through Resolume.
  Can you Record some video? *I mean Resolume recording function.*
  
  I'm currently using the demo trial, but when I record VVVV produced graphics, I only get blank (black) output.
  
  Is this due to the limitation of Demo Trial? (it's working for normal video process)
  or is this due to the vvvv produce GPU shared gfx, and could not be recorded?
