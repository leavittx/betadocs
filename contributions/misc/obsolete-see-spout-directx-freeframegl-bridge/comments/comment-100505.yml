  great!
  i get red nodes in b28, but not with b29.2. however, the streaming does not work. the <span class="pin">State</span> says ok and i have set the share name in resolume. i've also tried the update buttons.
  i have an nvidia 9500M GS. is there a way to find out if it supports NV_DX_interop?
