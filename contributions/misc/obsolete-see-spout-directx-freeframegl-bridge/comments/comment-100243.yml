  Hi elio, yes i've checked the texture format is A8R8G8B8. Even the help patch doesn't work. 
  I use resolume 4.1.2 running on bootcamp - windows7 MBP Retina Mid2012, vvvv version 45beta29.2_x64. Also tried upgrading to resolume 4.1.5 but didn't work. 
  I run vvvv shortcut with /dx9ex at the end of properties>shortcut>target. Hope it's not bootcamp prob.
