  dear metrowave,
  I saw that we have a very similar configuration.
  I followed your instructions and I created the bat file., I put it on the bin vvvv, and I took the name from the root of sharing examples of Helium.
  The plugin in Resolume works, but it does not transfer data from vvvv to resolume.
  could you send me an example with a tutorial?
  if you could send me some working example already tested?
  
  ps: excuse my english, I'm an Italian student
