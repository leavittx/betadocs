  Sound awesome, but not working here! can somebody help me?
  I've got Nvidia and followed the whole instruction,vvvv is running on dx9ex, put the DX texture in resolume>plugin>vfx, the plugin appieres on resolume. However nothing  shows up on the output.
  I see resolume crashing when I put wrong sharing name, so probobly something wrong on resolume side?
