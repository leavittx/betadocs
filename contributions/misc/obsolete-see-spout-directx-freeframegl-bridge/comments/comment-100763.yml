  today a new bug introduced: as soon as i open the source "DX Texture (RR)" Resolume crashes. regardless of vvvv is there or it isn't gaah. it was working like charm 2 days ago. i've changed nothing :(
  visual studio debugger says: "Unhandled exception at 0x0859DBCC (nvoglv32.dll) in Arena.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0xD3DBF00A." what can be done with it?
