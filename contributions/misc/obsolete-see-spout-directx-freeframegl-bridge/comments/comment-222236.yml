  hey this was all working perfectly for me untill I recently upgraded, has anyone come across this as well? 
  
  I switched from windows 8.1 to windows 10 and from resolume 4 to resolume 5 now and it doesnt seem to work anymore. Cant seem to get the help node output into resolume either. 
  
  The DX Texture (RR) is showing up in the FFGL sources, its just not getting any input
  
  my system
  
  Win10_x64
  Nvidia GTX 870M (driver updated)
  Vvvv_45beta34.1_x86
  Resolume Arena 5.0.0
  
  
  thanks in advance
  Rose
