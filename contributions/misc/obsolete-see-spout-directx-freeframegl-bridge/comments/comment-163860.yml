  anyone managed to get vvvv and unity to share a spout? Is it possible right now? Tried benkuper's methods but no joy so far, best I've maanged is a white texture in the vvvv receiver. (but with the correct info in the receiver patch, so something is kind of working).
  
  I will try on a different pc tomorrow...
