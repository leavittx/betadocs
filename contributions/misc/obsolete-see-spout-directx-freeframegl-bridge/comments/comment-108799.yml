  @psylion: yes you can record the "dx bridge" clip. even multiscreen renderer
  
  i did a 3 screen panorama show last weekend.
  
  vvvv renderer: 2400x600 
  resolume arena output: 3840x720 (=3x 1280x720)
  
  output of resolume was around 35fps - 40fps. with some fx applied
  pretty cool.
  
  i noticed that "dx bridge" provides faster fps than reading clips from SSD hd. i guess this depends on the pc configuration. very nice anyway.
  
  no crashes during the whole show. ~ around 6 hours.
  AND: vvvv does not "freeze" when changing values. unlike running vvvv in "standalone". (if i remember right..)
