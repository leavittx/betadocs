  @elio: microdee gave me the news about this, but i understand that you are the responsable of this, so 1 more time, THANK YOU!!!
  
  this was my 1st wish when i started vvvvjing almost 7 years ago! http://vjforums.com/showthread.php?t=20711
  
  The crash that i describer was with w7.64x and arena 4.0 , but i tested with 4.13 and it worked fine... i used for more than 6 hours yesterday and it was a pleasure :). I will test this new version again.
  
  1 more question,,, how hard would be to do it backwards... Resolume -> VVVV ?
  im doing it in a horrible way... output resolume on another monitor and using screenshot node to get the texture... is there any other better way at the moment ?  1 more time, excellent work, this will open vvvv world to a lot of new vjs!
  
  
  This is the 1st vercion that you uploaded
