  @metrowave : 
  
  I followed the instructions step by step, are very simple.
  Start the bat file and after "ShareTextureInfo (OpenGL, Interop) help.v4p."
  after using "ShareTextureInfo (OpenGL, Interop). V4P" See my name sharing that in the case of the example is: (vvvvToResolume / MainRenderer).
  start Resolume 4.1.6, I select the plug-in "rr_dxTexture.dll," write the name of sharing and I click update, but nothing appears.
  I have to copy vvvv_45beta30_x86 in C:?
  how should I configure the preferences Resolume? ..
  
  could you be kind enough to explain to me the proper configuration of both vvvv and Resolume ..
  
  thanks
