  Can someone help me with this:
  
  I need to convert a texture's format (e.g. D3DFMT_A8R8G8B8) and usage (e.g. D3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET) from VVVV enum to the real DX enum's value.
  
  The VVVV enum2ord is just a 1..N value and does not reflect the original constants). For me it seems to be hidden in black closed source boxes ;('''
