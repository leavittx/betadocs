  Last week has been so busy, I did not manage to answer. Sorry for that. Thanks for all the hints and debugging you did so far.
  
  @microdee: the AsString + SharedMemory may produce bugs. Until now, it's a messy workaround.
  
  @vux&others: Yes it's probably Intel's Optimus that's preventing all our mobile nvidia devices from working. Did someone already try to disable Optimus? (just as a proof).

  A few hours ago I've been talking to ft in order to bring wyphon [/forum-alpha/something-like-syphon-on-windows-%28currently-called-wyphon%29](/forum-alpha/something-like-syphon-on-windows-%28currently-called-wyphon%29) and my bridge togehther. Here are our plans:
  
  Wyphon shall internally still work with directx textures.
  But it will get some new helper functions. These allow for 
  a) accessing the shared DX textures as OpenGL textures
  b) for sharing an OpenGl Texture as a DirectX Texture
  
  This way we can communicate DX->DX, DX->GL, GL->DX, GL->GL. OpenGL applications shall also use an intermediate DX texture, that shouldn't be a performance problem.
  
  The Wyphon functions shall be integrated in two FreeframeGL plugins. One for importing textures, the other for exporting textures.
  
  And yes, GL->DX works, I just successfully did my proof of concept. Resolume made a Full HD stutter free output to VVVV!
  
  We'll let you know as soon as we have coded something clean & stable.
