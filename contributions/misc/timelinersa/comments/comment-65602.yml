  sorry to push Joreg :)
  but i really need some feedback on the "pause" action
  behaviour  regarding the current / coming next release?... 
  to know if have to adapt my whole timeliner patch uhhh hope not
  it should be up and running for the end of the month!
  or perhaps there is a workaround (using a "moded" previous version of timeliner inside beta45.1)
  thanks
