  hello,
  just found a strange behaviour in the current timeliner version (beta10.1 or the native beta 25.1 one):
  when there's a pause action (OnEnd) in  a state the next value is sent when the playhead pause at the end of the state!
  in the beta22 version the value was sent only when the next state was launched!!
  true for all types of data string, values, colors etc...
  assuming you snap the values with CTRL
  the loop / previous action seems to react as expected!
  in fact... when opening a beta22 project in beta 25.1 
  the states created in beta22 are ok (no pause action bug) but when you try to Re-snap them (CTRL + click drag) they keep their time position but with the
  pause action bug!!!
  
  the stop action seems to do something but don't know really what:)
  hope you can shade some light on this.
  thx
  charles
