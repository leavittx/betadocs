  Hello patchers!
  
  Here is a first version of the Music Wheel, a patch which helps explore the relationship between geometry and musical harmony.
  
  The idea is to enable a more intuitive understanding of certain music harmony concepts which are sometimes too abstract to grasp.
  
  It is still in development, so things like flats, proper note naming based on traditional harmony standards and other theorical aspects might not be 100% correct in all cases.  Sorry for that!
  
  In order to run the patch you must first install DX11, VAudio and then open the MusicWheel patch.
  
  Enjoy and let me know what you would like to see improved in the comments.
  
  Cheers!
