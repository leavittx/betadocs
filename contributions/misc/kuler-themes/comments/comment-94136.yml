  nice work! A friend has created a few kuler themes and i would like to access them directly. 
  Is there a way of getting a list of all the themes that user has created? 
  
  I cant find any info on which rss links are created by kuler for user themes. Maybe im just missing something :) ? Or is there an easy way to list my favorites?
  
  thx for this kul contribution :>
