  Just an update to retrieve Adobe Kuler Themes. 
  I found this legacy thread,[kuler-update](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/kuler-update) ,  and i decided to make it simpler and more useful. Fixed the Urls, improved the method to search or get feeds ,added a  save & load preset function, and retrieve of the theme title
  All youÂ´ll need is an adobe kuler key to make it work.

  Very useful for color gradients or palettes creation.
  Only Works with beta 29 (depend of asstring(raw) node)
