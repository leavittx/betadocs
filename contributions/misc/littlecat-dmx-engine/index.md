Little_cat will work with the following dmx interfaces:

0=NO_DMX_OUTPUT
1=SOUNDLIGHT_DMXUSB 1 & 2 (dashard.dll)
2=ENTTEC_OPENDMX
3=BOUCHEZ_LPTDMX
4=ENTTEC PRO
5=DMX512-ONLINE.NET
6=SUNLITE ( siudi 5-6) (dashard2006.dll)
7=USBDMX.COM
8=DMX4ALL
9=VELLEMAN K8062D aka VM116

In the future, plug-ins will be written to avoid this UDP trick. Just need time.
