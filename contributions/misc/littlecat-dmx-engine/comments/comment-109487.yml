  heym nice my enttec opendmx is working with this :)
  
  there is something strange.
  do you have an idea why the config_little_cat.txt is loading when I double click the application but it is not loading when I start the application from commandline (.bat)?
  
  So I get 'impossible to open config_little_cat.txt'
  
  its a luxus to get this kind of error massage at all :)
  
  edit: I got it, the config file must be in the same folder fom where the.bat is executed.
