  Ha !
  
  ... found the problem.
  
  The performance killer was setting all buffer sizes to ""UDP_TX_PACKET_MAX_SIZE" (donÂ´t know how big this is). I reduced this to 768 (more than big enough for the max packet size of artnet) and now performance even "feels" better than in the v2 version.
  ... i hope reducing/fixing the buffer size to 768 does not cause other problems ... but for me it is working fine.
  Testers, feedback, improvements of course are very welcome.
  
  The modified sketch that i named v3.1. can be downloaded here:[artnet-arduino-set-v3.1](xref:contribution/artnet-arduino-set-v3.1)
  
  Besides the buffer size i changed some more (minor) things, that made sense to me !?
  Here a little "Change Log" for my version v3.1:
  - performance gain by shrinking buffer sizes from "UDP_TX_PACKET_MAX_SIZE" to 768
  - implementation of selction / filtering SubnetID and UniverseID (was already prepared by karistouf)
  - channel count starts at 0 instead of 1 (the digital and vvvv way)
  - artnet start_address+n is now mapped to "arduino-channel" 0+n (was also start_address+n bevore), now it is similar to lighting fixtures
