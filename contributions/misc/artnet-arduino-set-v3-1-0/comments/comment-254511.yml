  Hi, karistouf!
  
  I want to control dmx devices via arduino and dmx. 
  
  The easiest thing is using Grove-DMX512, 3 commands ;) 
  
  ```
  #include <DmxSimple.h>
  DmxSimple.usePin(X);
  DmxSimple.write(CH,VAL);
  ```
  
  It works so far…
  
  But meanwhile 512 dmx channels are not enough, so I have to use artnet, but I have some problems with unterstanding the sketch "ARTNET_sender_10.ino" – I'm have no experience with artnet… :(
  
  Is there any documentation about sending cues for universe, channels and values?
  What are the correspondences?
  
  Best regrads…
