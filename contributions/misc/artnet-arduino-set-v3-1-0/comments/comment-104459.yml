  Hi,
  
  did anybody use v3 for arduino >=1.0 and compared performance with v2 ?
  
  I experienced that performance of v3 is much lower compared to v2.
  In fact refresh/framerate of the arduino (tested with uno and mega 2560) with v3 is so low that it is not really usable.
  The same artnet environment with v2 looks fine !?
  
  The difference in performance is so big that i doubt that is only a problem with the new UDB library in arduino 1.0 ... maybe there is a fundemental problem/mistake in the sketch !?
  Unfortunately my arduino/network knowledge is not good enough to be able to debug.
  
  Any ideas/solutions out there ? Karistouf ?
