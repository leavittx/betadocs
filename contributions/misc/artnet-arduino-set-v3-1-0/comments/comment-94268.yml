  I'm fairly new to Arduino and I'm running into an issue with Receiver.  I'm using Sender10 fine.
  
  I'm having difficulty with the UDP libraries.  I'm getting messages from the IDE such as "The Udp class in the Ethernet library has been renamed to EthernetUdp"  If I change the udp.h reference to EthernetUdp.h, I get errors on the Read statement.
  
  Can you tell me if the code is using old library references or if I need to import the correct libraries?  If so, can you point me to the correct place to download the libraries?
  
  Thanks for your help!
