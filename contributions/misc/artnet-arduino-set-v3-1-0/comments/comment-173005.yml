  Hi,
  
  Can I send a floating value through ARTnet to control something?  I wish to control the position of two steper motors in real time. I tried with RS232 but it is too slow, about 20 values/sec. through serial - 20 seconds for a single rotation...
  
  In the attached test patch I want to send integer values from 100 to 500 corresponding with a 400 steps - a full rotation of the stepper. I can not receive it back throug DMX receiver nor through RS232.

  In the arduino code I enabled the Serial feedback through RS232 node and it is included in the patch. Maybe I'm missing something here...
