  hi, sorry for delay. Hollydays...
  
  about your question this has nothing to do with patches:
  
  you have to pick up values you want from the artnet array **inside the sketch** and distribute them to your PWM like shown at the end of the reception sketch:
  
  //stuff to do on PWM or whatever
   analogWrite(3,buffer_dmx<3>);  
   analogWrite(5,buffer_dmx<5>); 
   analogWrite(6,buffer_dmx<6>);
  
  if you want to write value of channel 7 to PWM 3 its easy:
   analogWrite(3,buffer_dmx<6>); 
  buffer_dmx<6> because position <0> is Channel 1. So buffer_dmx<6> is channel 7, as buffer_dmx<511> is channel 512. 
  
  about digitals, you need to make a condition, like: 
  if(buffer_dmx<7>>0){digitalWrite(3,HIGH);}
  else{digitalWrite(3,LOW);}
  
  if you want to  control more than 6 PWM consider using softPWM lib. This means some coding in arduino in IDE and basic adaptation of the sketches
