  Being new to the arduino world i have a couple of questions.
  
  1-When setting up the Artnet Node in vvvv to communicate with an arduino UNO
    should I set it up with an ordinary spread of 512, and then for the
    sender sketch, Artnet channel 13,12,11,10,9,8,6,5 and 3 would controll    
    the output pins on the arduinoUNO board? 
    
  
  2-And for the reciver Sketch the same has to be done but diffrent channel
    to pin mapping?
  
  3-And for the diffrent types of inputs/outputs like digital,analog or PWM?
    PWM and analog would be like a fader with value from 0 TO 1, but digital 
    would be a toggle, value 0 OR 1?
  
  4- As im typing my questions I see that i really would love if someone 
     could make a patch I could look at =)
  
  Tnx
