  Hi again. Im having proplem to make this work, and its probably my mistake. 
  But a quick question. If i upload the code without doing any modifications to it to the arduino Uno and set the ip of my computer to 192.168.1.100 shouldnt it be up and running immediatly.
  
  Tnx
  
  EDIT: I got this working with the 0023 version (V2), But still no luck with v3 for arduino 1.0
