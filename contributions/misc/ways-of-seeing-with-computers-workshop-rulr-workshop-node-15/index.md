All the goods for:

* Calibrating cameras
* Calibrating kinect<>projector
* Calibrating camera<>projector
* Taking graycode scans in 2D and 3D (triangulated graycode scan)
* Loading kinect<>projector calibrations into VVVV for live 3D projection mapping
* Loading triangulated point clouds into VVVV for pixel-for-pixel 3D projection mapping onto scanned surfaces

Thanks to Simon HÃ¤nggi for getting all the files together at the end of the workshop and making this ZIP.

Prerequisites:

* Visual C++ 2013 x64 Runtime
* Kinect Runtime v2.0 v1409 (aka Kinect SDK)
* BlackMagic drivers (either Camera drivers or DeckLink drivers)

All prerequisites can be downloaded from: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_S1z3_AWMRSfmhrRDd1ZVYtY3lPUW5TR29XbDZ2Q1pVYWFrSXZMTVRkZmxsSF82ajlBTDg&authuser=0>.

Future versions shouldn't need Kinect or BlackMagic drivers, but the one packaged here does.
