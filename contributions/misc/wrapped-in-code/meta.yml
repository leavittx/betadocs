  **WRAPPED IN CODE**
  
  This is the patch, the entry installation of NODE15 was based on.
  The cloth simulation runs in a single compute shader and is quite performant.
  Texture based forces (similar to displacement) and multiple attractors are supported.
  
  Needs DX11 Pack.
  
  Limitations:
  Since this is no perfect shader code, it behaves differently on different graphic cards. You will have to fiddle with the thread dispatching settings, to get a situation that will work for your specific hardware.
  Also I have seen some weird behaviour on NVIDIA cards.
  
  I would be happy about any suggestions to improve this system.
  
  
  Have fun!
