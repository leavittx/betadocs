  Few tips: 1) Limit randomness by linking the same noise source (LFO in this case) to more effects. Then the effects cooperate in some way and it's interesting for viewer.
  2) Always take care of AspectRatio. You can scale View Matrix if you want scale.
  3) There are Antialiasing and other parameters on Renderer, mind them.
