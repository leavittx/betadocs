Simple point editor for creating some wobbly characters and other shapes.

Created as a personal excercise, after seeing this video: https://vimeo.com/113309406

i.e. can I rewrite the Processing program into vvvv?

Instructions are inside the patch but basically: left click to add a point; right click to finish the current shape; middle click to clear the playground; flip a switch to change between a drawing and "dancing" mode.

Tested in vvvv_45beta33.3_x64
Feedback welcome!
