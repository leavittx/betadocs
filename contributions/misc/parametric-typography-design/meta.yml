  Simple point editor for creating some wobbly characters and other shapes.
  
  Created as a personal excercise, after seeing this video: https://vimeo.com/113309406
  
  i.e. can I rewrite the Processing program into vvvv?
  
  Instructions are inside the patch but basically: left click to add a point; right click to finish the current shape; middle click to clear the playground; flip a switch to change between a drawing and "dancing" mode.
  
  Tested in vvvv_45beta33.3_x64
  Feedback welcome!
