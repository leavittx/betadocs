  sorry for delaying the english version...
  things got a bit busy
  
  from proofreading this guide, one can see there's a pretty significant step made from knowing nothing to knowing a lot across many different topics. It's really ambitious and hits the note correctly in a lot of areas. It takes a range of 'unknowing' starting points for users and walks them through lots of important things that they need to know.
  
  The guide picks up on many points that I wouldn't have remembered to document, but are obviously indispensable to know during the learning process.
  
  And i (personally) think it'd be fantastic if more people got involved with helping to develop content for this guide (perhaps for a second, third edition). This way we could expand on the amount of 'starting points' that people could come from, and help refine the guide.
  
  What I specifically suggest is that those people who are teaching VVVV, try to use this guide as a reference for their course, and relay back feedback from students to improve the guide into the future.
