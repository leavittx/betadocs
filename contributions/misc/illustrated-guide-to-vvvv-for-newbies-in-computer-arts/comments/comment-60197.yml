  Great comment Elliot!
  I support every of your words. Please join us for future editions!
  
  But either I would like to ask today's vvvv users to try the guide with their girlfriends/boyfriends or with their little brothers and sisters. And the best, if we try it with artistic persons, who was not involved in computer arts before.
  And please give us most critic feedback you can. It's very pleased to read kind words, but they do not help to move forward. 
  
  Finally, I would like to ask vvvv group to join us for future editions. 
  
  Thank you very much
