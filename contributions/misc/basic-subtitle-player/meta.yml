  This is a very basic patch, and surely there is more to do and better.
  
  This reader is a stand alone patch with a GUI and a renderer.
  It is dedicated to make subtitles on theatre or opera pieces. If you are in a hurry, well sure this may help.
  
  Its very basic:
  a text file contains the subtitles. 
  They are formatted in a certain way, to get number of lines and separate the different subtitles:
  
  
  ```
  ##STR 1 2
  This is my first row of text
  This is my second row, wich will be readen
  
  ##STR 2 1
  Because second argument is number of rows
  
  ##STR 3 4
  In fact you have in 
  this patch up to
  4 different lines
  wich will be printed
  ```
