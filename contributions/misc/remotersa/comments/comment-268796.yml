  Oh no , sorry for the misunderstanding. It works perfectly! I even shoved PStools in the same folder so it is tidy.
  I just spent the last 2 days getting Beta6 and PSTools to work and this is like telepathy. 
  
  The Get MAC+HostName was not working on Beta6 For me, but again it might be just my machines, now it is instant. 
  WOL works too! Dont need to reach in the computer Rack anymore!
  
  Regarding the "not responding" part yes this might be the firewall, but i cant kill it for now for .. umm reasons :) 
  
  EXP button, got it. I am just using another Sync Software so that was why the button does nothing for me. 
  
  Again thanks for the contribution !
