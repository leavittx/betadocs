  @joreg I guess what I would like is to be able to create a more user friendly UI for it, so people starting and stopping an exhibition can't press the wrong button.
  
  I have on a couple of occasions created some fullscreen renderers with start Exhibition and stop exhibition. and it would be nice to have the functionality of remoter, but shield a non-tech end user from the way too many options.
  
  Maybe I am thinking about this in the wrong way
