  Thanks Joreg, Yes, there is something wrong with the zip, using 7zip I was able to unzip it and it works. never thought about that here.. 
  
  You can't use New when it's broken. And btw, I checkt which file is "corrupt": It's Remoter.dll, after changing this file only to the 7zip-version it worked.
