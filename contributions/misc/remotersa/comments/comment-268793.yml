  And i just got Beta6 to work. 
  Actually only thing that was not working was the Get MAC+Hostname function. 
  
  One question tho, is it me or when you give a command to a few machines it takes a while and if you try to click on the Remoter it can say "Not responding"
  
  Also if i may ask, what does the small EXP button does under the VNC button (shy)? 
  
  Thanks for the great contribution still :)
