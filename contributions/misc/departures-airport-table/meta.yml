  Asset to be used in your projects, it is not really possible to find a working model of table like this, so enjoy!
  
  You can write anything in, and table will write it out for you with flip-boards.
  
  It is the most basic version of the project, it expects specific number of characters, etc. but its very easy to customize and learn from.
  
  Also I would be super interested in how would you people approach this, if anyone can optimize and simplify, post it here!
  
  It is all hand crafted apart from the font, I even recorded the sound.
  
  includes font, .AI, .blend and ableton project files
