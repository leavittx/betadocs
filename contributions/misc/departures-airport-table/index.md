Asset to be used in your projects, it is not really possible to find a working model of table like this, so enjoy!

You can write anything in, and table will write it out for you with flip-boards.

It is the most basic version of the project, it expects specific number of characters, etc. but its very easy to customize and learn from.

Also I would be super interested in how would you people approach this, if anyone can optimize and simplify, post it here!

It is all hand crafted apart from the font, I even recorded the sound.

includes font, .AI, .blend and ableton project files
