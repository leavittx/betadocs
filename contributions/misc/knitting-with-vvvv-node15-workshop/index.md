This contributions enables you to explore the possibilities of generating pixel graphics with VVVV and translate them into knitted objects.

Semi automated domestic knitting machines from the 80ies/ 90ies are the perfect models for replacing their original controllers with Arduino based new electronics (huge thanks to AYAB). These are then connected with vvvv. The machine has 200 needles with every needle corresponding to one pixel in width, while the length can be virtually infinite. The difference to existing software is, that vvvv allows you to communicate with the machine constantly. You can generate patterns in „realtime“ and  send your commands line per line.
