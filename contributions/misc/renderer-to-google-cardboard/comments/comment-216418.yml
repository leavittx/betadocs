  hi vasilis, yes, but with some alternative software to Hyperimu and Intugame on other platforms you'll just need to readapt the headtracking communication part.
  Btw Intugame has a iOS app the GYROSC should do the hyperimu job with some adjustment in the patch, in the end you need to get the orientation quaternion as with hyperimu.
  lemme know if you get it working with other plaforms!
