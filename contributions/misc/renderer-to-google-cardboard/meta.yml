  http://intugame.com/ makes a nice free app+server combo that streams your desktop to an android device, it 's enjoyable and with an acceptable lag for a soo cheap VR setup.
  I belive it can be used with many Others VR headsets wich load an andoriod inside.
  Here are a DX9 and DX11 patches i made to test it out.
  Start the apps on the pc and the phone, connect them via WIFI or USB tethering, maximize the stereoscopic renderer, hide borders and enjoy vvvv depthnesss;) 
  
  Update: 
  Added a version with headtracking support thru HyperIMU.
  For a low latency video stream you can use http://limelight-stream.com/ (Requires you have gamestream capable NVIDIA card).
