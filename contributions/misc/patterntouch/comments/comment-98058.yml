  Hey alg,
  first of all thanks for sharing your work!
  I tried your PatternTouchDebug patch and I found a strange behavior. When I scale or rotate 2 objects at the same time (e.g. using a multitouch with 4 hands), sometimes the transformations work only on 1 object. In this case the ID number on the bug object is -1. I tested the patch with a IR multitouch frame.
