  ### PatternTouch - multi touch framework for vvvv, based on common user interaction patterns.
  
  #### Features:
  
  * Translate, Scale, Rotate gestures (all via center).
  * Alpha channel support.
  * GPU based intersection analysis, especially useful for complex meshes. 
  * Display List support via Group node.
  * Created with vvvv in mind.
  
  #### In next releases:
  
  * Pan and Zoom gestures.
  * Transformation limits with iOS like behavior.
  * Multidirectional swipe gesture.
  * Photo Gallery module.
  
  #### Limitations:
  
  * No sorting support. All transformations always sorted by ID.
  * No complex transformation hierarchies. For example, if you have a touchable element in container and want to scale this container, you need to touch container only in empty places. Upper object always receive all blobs.
  
  #### Bugs:
  
  * VPA (PatternTouch Split) outputs zero AspectRation matrix if no input connected.
