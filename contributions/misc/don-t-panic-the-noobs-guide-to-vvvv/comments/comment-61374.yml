  hi joreg... roman_g is a good solution BUT the interface of the foxit phantom is quiet painfull for colors correction, edition of objects and troubles with fonts. Could it be possible one day that this beautifull panic guide could be redone with open office draw that we can change easely fonts languages etc ?
