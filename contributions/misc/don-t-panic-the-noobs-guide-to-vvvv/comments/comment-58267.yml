  @sapo:
  All files on top are updated to editable versions. 
  
  Download the 30 days testversion of "Foxit phantom". 
  *Should be enough for your translation :)*
  Here the download Link:
  <http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/phantom/>
  
  
  Just open one of the .pdf files with this programm and you have the opportunity to edit all texts. 
  The shortcut for editing is ctrl+t. 
  Now you are in the Touch Up Object Mode and if you select a part of the text you can edit or detete it.
  
  You also find this Mode in the Header Menu:
  *Edit > TouchUp Objects Tool*
