  Hi patrick ,-) 
  OOO is in vectors no bitmap. so its lightweight and it s easy to redo the presentation. 
  OOO is free and enables layers, wich is less painfull i you have layers for background and layers for text. Those layers may be locked, etc etc.... ;-) 
  i forget to talk about the complete language set being supported and pdf exports ;-)
