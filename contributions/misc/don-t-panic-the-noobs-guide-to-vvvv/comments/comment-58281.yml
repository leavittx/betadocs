  thanks, installed it, testing it, the first sentence should be changed to "per iniziare" but i can't type the z into the first text field, in the search field and outside Foxit phantom works fine.. weird.. just noticed i cannot type also q, j , y, f.. in the first text field , bu i can type them in the "NODE" text field ..extra weird.. maybe is the font that has been partially included inthe pdf?
