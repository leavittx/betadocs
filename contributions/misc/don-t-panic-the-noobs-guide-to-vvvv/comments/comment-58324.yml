  And done! <http://www.sapolab.com/4v/nientepanico_45beta25-ITA.pdf>
   
  maybe it's even too much translated :D
  after a hour of work foxit decided to just disappear(crash) without a warning.. thank god i saved in at somepoint of the job, then it crashed twice again while editing. i just saved often. 
  i noticed 2 small errors in the original pdf
  1: search for screeshot
  2: one of the two "Scroll Patch up and down" is missing  a "fast"
  
  i guess the ITA version has some error too but i'll review it later! the most.. is done! yayyyy
