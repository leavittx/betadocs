  Hey Dominik! you have any updates on why it wasn't working on several laptops?
  
  what was the actual problem? It's a really cool and easy way to do projection mapping..Actually is the easiest way I saw till now so it would be nice to have it working on every laptop.
  
  Thanks
  
  edit...With nvcuda.dll is working perfectly.
