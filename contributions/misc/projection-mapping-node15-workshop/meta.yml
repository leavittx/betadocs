  ####  Projection Mapping w/ vvvv
  
  Hereyougo, all the patches we used for the Projectionmapping workshop at NODE15.
  
  In case there's something missing, or you'd like to know something about the workshop or the topic in general, getintouch.
  
  We worked in 'steps', and there are folders for STEPS and finishedSTEPS, the one tells you where to start and the other tells you where to go. Just try it out!
