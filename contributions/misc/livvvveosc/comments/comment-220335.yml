  hi, great and useful stuff ! thanks for all your efforts !
  
  lately i was trying to set the time signature for a whole ableton LIVE project. unfortunately this doesn't seem to be defined in the python code. 
  
  the "OSCAPI.txt" file says it's possible to set a CLIP's time signature with "/live/clip/signature" but what about the project's time signature ? would it be possible to add/change some lines of code to get there ? or is there some other trick to achieve this ?
  
  best
  
  oliver
