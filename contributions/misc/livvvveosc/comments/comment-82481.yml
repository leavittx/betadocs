  Hi there- seems to be a typo or problem in the latest version - the host addresses and ports in liveOSC.py and also the example patch may be set to your PC. 
  
  Anyway that's not my problem - I can't get this to work. Just using localhost. Neither version (old or new) seems to communicate with live - it seems to send messages on UDP but ableton doesn't react. 
  
  I've followed the instructions several times and tried with different versions of vvvv, and tried localhost and fixed IP addresses.
  Any known problems e.g with live 8.2.8 by any chance? 
  
  I tried on two different computers running win7. One running a firewall, one not.
  
  thanks!
