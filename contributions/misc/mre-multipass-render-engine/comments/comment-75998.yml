  @gregsn:
  The main requirement of this approach is that no geometry is lighted by multiple lights. Rooms are really separated (at lighting level at least; they could anyway share the same space).
  So, if we happy with this, we definitively can organize the modules into lighting spaces.
  LightingSpace module will contain:
  -object modules
  -light module (unified with vsm module)
  
  One consideration:
  The environment module must not be placed into each Room(lightingSpace) because it's not light dependent and is also unique (in your version there are 2 overlapping backgrounds, you can see if zoom out with the camera).
  It Should be a Environment moudule near the lightingspace modules, in the root patch.
  
  Agree on light patch cleanup (separation between position menagement and the rest...)
  
  
  ...future improvements in multi-lights management will require a completely different approach, called deferred shading  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading>
