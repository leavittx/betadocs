  @all: thanks a lot, we really are pleased by your responce.
  
  @gregsn: i know there're quite a lot of connections and patch is kind of messy already with simple scene.
  That's why i'm working on a new version with more modules and s/r nodes.
  Hope to find a more confortable setting.
  thanks again for your appreciation  :)
  
  @sur: mmm...strange your DOF doesn't work... did you tried with a clean beta27 with addonpack? what's your graphic card?
  If you find the pdf cryptical, you could search for some tutorial on basic hlsl shaders, to better understand their structure. there's plenty of them, just google it.
  As i said in the pdf, the only difference between common shaders and MRE ones is the MultiRenderTarget (MRT) part. search also for it  ;)
  let me know if you want to know more specific things...
  
  ciao
  
  NOTE FOR EVERYONE:
  MRE NEEDS ADDONPACK IN ORDER TO WORK CORRECTLY IN EACH PART
  let me add this to the contrib description...
