  tnx to everyone! happy that you enjoy it   :)
  @u7angel: your probelm is not related to the engine's shaders, it's about UV texture coordinates generated by Sphere (EX.9 Geometry) node. 
  the sphere mesh should be like a grid deformed, so where it closes there are overlapping points with different U texture coords (0 and 1).
  ...Like the Cylinder node works.
