Hello evvvverybody! It’s dottore here,I’m back after some months of silence.
I’m happy to introduce you to this Multipass Render Engine, which is the result of the collaboration between me, m4d, vux and unc.

In the folder you can find a small pdf introduction to the engine.

NOTE:
MRE NEEDS ADDONPACK IN ORDER TO WORK CORRECTLY.
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT IN THE DOWNLOADS SECTION OF THIS SITE.
