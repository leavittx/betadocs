This is a standalone timelining application similar to the original [TimelinerSA](xref:contribution/timelinersa). Read the [announcement](/blog/timelinersa-next-generation-alpha-grade-release) for details.

<div class="box">
Note:
If you see only a blank window, move the timeliner folder to a sane path like C:\mystuff\timeliner. desktop might not work.
</div>
