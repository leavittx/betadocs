  Hm for example, "+0.5" did not work for me. I found out that I have to use "+0,5" (and a little adjustment to handle the |...| syntax in the XML).
  
  I uploaded a fixed version which should work with both, comma and dot decimal separators.
  
  Still strange that it worked for you before the fix. Did you use dot or comma? Maybe VVVV does some localization here.
