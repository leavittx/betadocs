  This module will save you SECONDS of time -- if not even milliseconds. Quickly create common arithmetic caluclations like **+1**, **/2**, etc. without having to always set the "Input 2" pin of the new node. Not sure, but I think puredata does it that way.
  
  1. Just double-click into the patch as you would if you created a new node
  2. type e.g. "+100" (without quotes)
  3. hit enter
  4. You will get a "+ (Value)" node, with its "Input 2" pin set to 100 instantly.
  
  Place this module anywhere (e.g. in your root)
  
  Supported Operators are: **+, -, /, *, %, =, <, >** and **@** (which will result in GetSlice (Spreads)
  
  Will most likely break something.
