  Extract this zip file to your SvvvvitcherV1 (beta23) folder. 
  
  Note that I did not include my _root_MAIN therefore you should attach IO boxes to the last 4 pins of the engine.
  
  Press shift+o to enable OSC Learn. It functions just like MIDI learn.
  
  - Tested with beta vvvv 25.1
  - Default receive port is 999 (keep it below 1000)
  - Default send port is 1111
  
  R2 Upgrade (added 3/11/11):
  - Adds the ability to send via OSC the name of the last slider modified via OSC. To find out the name of a slider, just move it slightly. Please install the included TouchOSC layout it will make a lot of sense when you test it out. Note: OSC Send must be enabled and properly configured for this feature to work.
