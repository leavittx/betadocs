  hei miro, note that the Contour node also returns a <span class="pin">Contours BinSize</span> for each of the contours it detects. connecting that to the Line nodes <span class="pin">BinSize</span> gives a separate line around each characters element in your example. then also note the <span class="pin">Closed</span> on the Line to finish things up..
