this is the re-release of vvvv_33beta1 as it was originally released on december 24th 0f the wonderful year of 2002. 

we put that one out after about 8 months (iirc) in development from scratch and... the rest is history.

now the problem is that we don't get it to run anymore. so the challenge is open to all of you h4x0r5: fix it!
