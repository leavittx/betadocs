  Hey,
  Thanks for this tutorial, has opened up a whole new world for me.. I attended one of your classes at MAD Lab the other year and we touched on 3d mapping at the end.. I'd never quite managed to figure it out until this so thanks!
  I've created a patch to hook up the iPad with touchOSC and it allows the alignments to be done remotely which is great for larger scale mapping projects, and you can also use it to control the show.. 
  It's not really in a shareable state, but maybe I'll get it there one day..
  
  Just wanted to say thanks :)
  
  Stu
