  Nice work! I'm just wondering if this tutorial is still supposed to be the "tool to use" for 3d projection mapping in **vvvv_beta_39_x64**? I was following the tutorial and made the same observation as [nrsz](http://vvvv.org/users/nrsz). In addition there is an exception thrown saying:
  
  * 00:10:13 ERR : Exception occured in TMPluginWrapperNode.Evaluate
  * 00:10:13 ERR : The type initializer for 'Emgu.CV.CvInvoke' threw an exception.
  
  But there are no permanent red nodes (only temporary).
  
  <div class="box">
  So, basically my question is, if there is an up-to-date tool resemblig the functionality or a work-around getting the libraries running? I found the **Step01_CalibrateProjector** patch in the VL.OpenCV package, which looks quite great but maybe there are other tool or workflows.

  Thank you for your help!
