  @ mrboni yes I ended up doing the same (also with calibrate camera).  It seemed to work for my purposes but I'm not sure if scaling the Z at -1 is 100% correct.  Also from memory I think I did that on the perspective transform.
  
  Would love to hear from Elliot about this, I thought he mentioned in his workshop at Node13 that some of the open CV stuff might be working with an Open Framewroks style matrix.
