  hi chriss0212	
  
  i have just download a fresh last vvvv_45beta31.2_x86 with its addons also last version of [directx11-nodes-alpha](xref:contribution/directx11-nodes) which is 31.2 version as well, then vvvv.packs_.image-b31-x86 . 
  
  i was missing VVVV.Nodes.SpreadTableValue.dll but took it from other version and worked btw i vote for this one to be in the addons.
  
  Then as you said input element node was red ,you just double click and select the node again and it works, that happens sometime with some older DX11 nodes i guess there was a  change on the naming but nodes are there. 
  
  I have saved it and uploaded it ;D.
