This is just a small patch that explain the basics of modbus TCP.

Modbus, and now Modbus TCP is a wide spread industrial protocol which allows you to control or get data from many industrial device such as :
- Motor driver
- Relay board
- Some rotary encoder
- Wide list of sensors 
...

This protocol as been invented by Modicon company (Schneider Electric) but it's openly published and royalty-free.

This patch explain the modbus TCP only, but with a simple converter you can also control RS485 modbus devices.

Hope this will help some of you.
