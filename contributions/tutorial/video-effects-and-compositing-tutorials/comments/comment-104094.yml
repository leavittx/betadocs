  @[The3rdIcon](http://vvvv.org/users/The3rdIcon):
  The 64-Bit build is missing some nodes for example the VLC node used in the first example.
  
  [missing-in-64bit-builds](https://vvvv.org/documentation/missing-in-64bit-builds)
  
  Just download the 32 Bit build and addonpack and unpack them separately, you can switch installations anytime by starting the according crack.exe.
