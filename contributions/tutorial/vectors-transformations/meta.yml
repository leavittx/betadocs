  Transformations and vector math are the basic building block of any animation in 2d and 3d. 
  You need them to position individual graphical elements in space but also for cameras looking at them and viewports within the renderer. 
  We have a look on vector operations and how to build virtual cameras, billboards, multiscreen applications, and pixelbased rendering.
  
  Second revision: 
  workshop material from Anton Mezhiborskiy and Sebastian Gregor @ NODE 15.
