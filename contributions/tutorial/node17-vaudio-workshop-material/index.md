The material shown and created at the VAudio workshop at NODE17

There are three folders in the zip file:

1. **_WorkshopMaterial** this is the main workshop folder with the content used and created at the workshop
1. **AcidMachine** the Acid-techno machine demonstrated at the Keynode at NODE15: https://youtu.be/hSBx4L1LVrk?t=2h11m8s (You can hear some extra music on the video from the amazing NODE15 Keynode Band)
1. **VideoToAudio** here you find a patch that translate a line in a video image into sound. Used in 2016 to real time modulate the image from the Eurovision Song Contest.

The requirements are:

VAudio pack: [vvvv.audio-pack-alpha](xref:contribution/vvvv.audio-pack-alpha)
ASIO audio interface, if you don't have one, you can use ASIO4all http://www.asio4all.de/
The correct architecture for the VST plugins referenced in the patches.
