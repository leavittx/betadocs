Interfacing Reaktor and vvvv

In this two part workshop you learn about Reaktor and how to use it together with vvvv for audio-visual creations.

Reaktor is a powerful modular and node based programming environment for sound.

With over 3000 open source instruments and deep integration of OSC at hand it allows you to create high quality sounds for your vvvv patches, installations and videos.

The first part of the workshop focuses on the introduction of some core principles of Reaktor and how to set up data streams from and to vvvv.

The second part asks for your contribution: The workshop leaders will help you to hook up your own vvvv patches and controllers to dedicated Reaktor instruments and effects.
