  Hello Everybody,
  i spent some days in writing this guide so you will better understand ParticlesGPU and hope will be able to customize it as you want.
  this is really a pre release of the guide, it's not finished. (my laptop's GPU is dead, so i can't procede anymore..)
  As soon as possible i'll post a new release of the document.
  
  **You can download the ParticlesGPU library here:**
