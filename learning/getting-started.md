# Getting Started

## 0. Checklist

* The below guide is for vvvv beta. More likely these days you're interested in the **all-new vvvv gamma**. [Start here!](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/getting-started/overview.html)
* Can vvvv do what you want? See the [Propaganda](https://vvvv.org/propaganda) page for an overview of vvvv's main capabilities and where to find info about them.  
* Needs Windows 7/8/10/11
* 3 button mouse (recommended)  

## 1. Download

vvvv is available in two different forms:  
* [Beta](https://vvvv.org/downloads) - stable releases. **Production grade**  
* [Previews](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews) - has more features, but maybe unstable. **Don't use for production**  

Take the **64bit** version.  

## 2. Install
Run the installer.
